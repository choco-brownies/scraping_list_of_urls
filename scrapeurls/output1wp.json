You could comfortably hang your resolution hat on two of the biggest: eat more vegetables and less added sugar.\n", "But there have been exciting shifts in what it means to eat well, shaped both by modern culinary style and bona fide nutritional science. They've been building for years but now have a definite form. This is a change that is real, compelling and refreshing.", "Healthy eating has emerged rebranded from a stodgy, finger-wagging \"should\" to a cool, on-trend \"want to.\" Harnessing the momentum of this fashionable, new healthy could re-energize your efforts to eat better in the new year and beyond, inspiring a way of eating that's good for you with — yes, more vegetables and less sugar — but also a fresh, updated perspective, one that's as hip and appealing as it is good for you.

Even longtime diet programs such as Weight Watchers have heeded the call with their new Freestyle program. Crash diets haven't totally disappeared — they have just been renamed detoxes and cleanses, and I recommend avoiding them — but the overall shift to healthy as a way of life has arrived and is a welcome bandwagon worth jumping on.", "In print, on Instagram feeds and in restaurants from fine to fast-casual, vegetables have graduated from a sidelined afterthought to center stage, and there are more compelling vegan and vegetarian options available than ever before. Vegetables are given luxe treatment with decadent-tasting but good-for-you sauces such as tahini or pesto and spun into comfort foods such as potato nachos, Buffalo cauliflower and zucchini noodles. There has never been a better time to be, or try to become, a vegetable lover.", "Counting fat grams has gone the way of the Walkman. There is just no need for it. There is now a body of evidence that fats — especially those from whole foods such as nuts, seeds, avocado and fish and healthy oils — are good for our nutritional well-being, benefiting our heart health, blood sugar and weight, to name a few. Just ignore the rampant butter-is-back headlines. Even if saturated fat is not the demon it was once thought to be, it is still healthier to replace animal fat with that from plants. Hello, avocado toast.", "Protein is practically synonymous with healthy today, a trend that's inspiring a more balanced plate than that of the bagel-for-breakfast days of yore. Along with the movement toward plant-based foods, this new way of eating has led to a rediscovery of powerfully nutritious beans, ­lentils, peas, nuts and seeds, as chefs and home cooks interpret them with modern culinary prowess. Take advantage of all that but avoid getting ensnared in the more-is-better mentality and ­falling prey to marketing tactics that leverage grams of protein for health points. Include some ­protein at each meal or snack but remember: Protein-fortified cookies are still cookies.", "Refined sugar has never been billed as healthy per se, but there is a greater awareness and more scientific evidence than ever of its detrimental health effects. The food community and marketplace have stepped up with exciting savory options where there were once only sweet, such as with energy bars and yogurt flavors. There has also been a tasty, healthier shift to using fiber- and nutrient-rich whole foods such as dried and fresh fruit as sweeteners in baked goods, smoothies and bars. Still, it's okay to have a little added sugar in your life, but the American Heart Association recommends keeping it to six teaspoons a day for women and nine for men.", "The scientists on the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee included considerations of sustainability and environmental impact in their recommendations to the Department of Agriculture, but although that issue didn't make the final guidelines, it has steadily gained traction with the public. More and more people understand that their individual health is integrally linked with the health of our planet, and they are taking steps to eat greener by eating more plant-based meals, choosing sustainable fish, poultry and meats, and reducing waste.", "Healthy means looking beyond the grams and percentages on the nutrition facts label to the ingredients in a product. People want to know what's in the food they are buying and how it was produced. Demand for simpler ingredient lists have compelled many manufacturers to remove artificial colors and flavors and other additives that didn't need to be there in the first place.", "The relatively recent discovery of the microbiome has transformed the way we look at health. We now know that the good bacteria in our guts are key not only to digestive health but to overall wellness, and the foods that support the microbiome are hotter than ever with ancient, probiotic-rich fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt and kefir making a modern comeback. There are more exciting varieties of these \"living\" foods available in the regular supermarket.", "Beyond probiotics, looking back to move forward applies more broadly to today's approach to healthy eating. Nutrition experts, chefs and the public alike are recognizing that there is more than one path to eating well, and there is wisdom in the global variety of traditional foodways. As we tap into that we are rediscovering heirloom and wild fruits and vegetables, heritage grains such as farro and sorghum, and patterns of eating that nourished our ancestors for generations.", "Healthy today breaks the old-fashioned mold of the divided plate and instead is built up in layers, arranged in bowls, piled into jars or whirred into a to-go cup.

Whole fruit is healthy, and juice comes from fruit, so it must be healthy, too. But when you make juice, you leave some of the most wholesome parts of the fruit behind. The skin on an apple, the seeds in raspberries and the membranes that hold orange segments together — they are all good for you. That is where most of the fiber, as well as many of the antioxidants, phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals are hiding. Fiber is good for your gut; it fills you up and slows the absorption of the sugars you eat, resulting in smaller spikes in insulin. When your body can no longer keep up with your need for insulin, Type 2 diabetes can develop.", "Finally, when you drink your calories instead of eating them, your brain doesn’t get the same “I’m full” signal that it does from solid food, even though you wind up consuming far more calories in the process. Whereas an orange may contain 45 calories, an eight-ounce glass of orange juice contains 110 calories, and a large kale, banana and orange juice blend at a leading juice chain contains 380 calories. We always counsel patients to chew their food; people tend to overconsume liquid calories. In addition, you might feel full immediately after drinking a glass of juice or a fresh smoothie, but that sensation goes away quickly as the liquid quickly empties out of your stomach, and many of those calories you just drank don’t get counted in your body’s internal calorie counter contributing to that bulging waistline the gym was supposed to help fix. When researchers gave adults an apple to eat — either as a whole fruit, fresh applesauce, apple juice or apple juice with the fiber added back — followed 15 minutes later by a meal, on the day they ate the apple, ", " at the meal than if they consumed the same number of calories from applesauce or apple juice. The chewing really counts.", "Our perception of juice needs a radical makeover, starting with our kids. Juice comes in easy, single-serving, shelf-stable packages that parents don’t hesitate to give to kids anywhere. Yet children don’t need juice for nutritional purposes, and most juice boxes contain more than the 4-to-6-ounce maximum ", " for daily consumption by kids under 6. In fact, kids who drink juice regularly are shorter and heavier than those who rarely drink juice, probably because they consume less milk, something ", " for healthy growth.", "The perception that juice is good for kids comes in part from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, better known as WIC, which provides food assistance to 25 percent of all pregnant women and half of all children in the United States at some point in their first five years of life. While the program has ", " birth outcomes and cognitive development in participants, it needs some revision. WIC supplies a very narrow range of foods deemed healthy for pregnant women and growing children. This includes healthy staples such as milk and eggs but also, surprisingly, a gallon of juice per month. When the program started in the 1970s, there was no obesity epidemic, and undernutrition was a major concern. In that context, giving juice rather than fresh fruits and vegetables — which didn’t have the year-round availability they do now — may have made sense. Today, it just feeds the false perception that juice is a healthy choice.", "So what can we do to start fixing this problem? First, recognize juice for what it is: a treat. It doesn’t belong at your breakfast table or in your post-workout routine. Next, get juice out of your children’s lives. Ditch the juice boxes in favor of water or shelf-stable milk boxes. Not only does milk contain about a third of the sugar of juice, it’s also a great source of the protein, calcium, vitamin D and magnesium that growing kids need. Make sure that their day care or after-school program is following current guidelines and serving only milk or water. Finally, the National Academies recently ", " for revisions to WIC, including a lower juice allowance. Write the Department of Agriculture and let officials know that you support the reduction or elimination of juice in the WIC program.", "While we can’t solve the diabetes and obesity epidemics with any one move, rebranding juice from a health food to a treat would be a major step in the right direction.", "Follow the latest on the outbreak with our newsletter every weekday.

The study is sure to renew a vigorous debate over how much people can do to prevent cancer and how much is unavoidable.", "The researchers, mathematician Cristian Tomasetti and cancer geneticist Bert Vogelstein, both of Johns Hopkins University, set out to determine what proportion of cancer mutations are due to unpredictable DNA-copying errors — as opposed to the two other main contributors to cancer, inherited genes and environmental factors, such as smoking and obesity.", ", the scientists used a mathematical model that analyzed genome sequencing and epidemiological data for 32 types of cancer. Overall, they concluded, 66 percent of mutations that contribute to cancer are due to unavoidable DNA-replication mistakes, while 29 percent are attributable to environmental factors and 5 percent to heredity. That doesn't mean that two-thirds of cancer cases are caused by random copying errors, they said; it can take three, four or more mutations to make a cell turn malignant.", "Moreover, the proportion of mutations due to random copying errors varies depending on the cancer, the researchers said.

They wanted to determine why, for example, cancer is more likely to develop in the colon than in the brain. They found a strong correlation between cancer incidence and the number of times the stem cells in the tissues divide. They figured that the more cells divide, the higher the potential for random DNA-copying mistakes — and attributed the errors to “bad luck.”", "But critics disliked the “bad luck” explanation and complained that the study was limited to the United States and didn't include the most common cancers — breast and prostate.", "In a new analysis also reported Thursday, which included information on breast and prostate cancers, Tomasetti and Vogelstein said they had done additional work that confirmed and broadened their 2015 conclusions.

Yet it took more than 40 years  — that is, until today —  for a clear picture of the results to reach the public.", "The fuller results appeared Tuesday in BMJ, a medical journal, featuring some never-before-published data. Collectively, the fuller results undermine the conventional wisdom regarding dietary fat that has persisted for decades and is still enshrined in influential publications such as the U.S. government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  But the long-belated saga of the Minnesota Coronary Experiment may also make a broader point about how science gets done: it suggests just how difficult it can be for new evidence  to see the light of day when it contradicts widely held theories.", "The story begins in the late 1960s and early ’70s, when researchers in Minnesota engaged thousands of institutionalized mental patients to compare the effects of two diets.  One group of patients was fed a diet intended to lower blood cholesterol and reduce heart disease. It contained less saturated fat, less cholesterol and more vegetable oil. The other group was fed a more typical American diet.", "Just as researchers expected, the special diet reduced blood cholesterol in patients. And while the special diet didn’t seem to have any effect on heart disease, researchers said they suspected that a benefit would have appeared if the experiment had gone on longer.", "There was “a favorable trend,” they wrote, for younger patients.", "Today, the principles of that special diet — less saturated fat, more vegetable oils — are recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the government’s official diet advice book. Yet the fuller accounting of the Minnesota data indicates that the advice is, at best, unsupported by the massive trial. In fact, it appears to show just the opposite:  Patients who lowered their cholesterol, presumably because of the special diet, actually suffered ", " heart-related deaths than those who did not.", "The higher rate of mortality for patients on the special diet was most apparent among patients older than 64.", "The new researchers, led by investigators from the National Institutes of Health and the University of North Carolina, conclude that the absence of the data over the past 40 years or so may have led to a misunderstanding of this key dietary issue.", "“Incomplete publication has contributed to the overestimation of benefits and underestimation of potential risks” of the special diet, they wrote.", "“Had this research been published 40 years ago, it might have changed the trajectory of diet-heart research and recommendations” said Daisy Zamora, a researcher at UNC and a lead author of the study.", "The new research drew quick criticism, however, especially from experts who have been prominent in the campaign against saturated fats.", "\"The bottom line is that this report adds no useful new information and is irrelevant to current dietary recommendations that emphasize replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat,\" Walter Willett, chair of the nutrition department at Harvard University, said in a blog post from the school. \"Many lines of evidence support this conclusion.\"", "He characterized the new analysis of the old experiment as \"an interesting historical footnote.\"", "***", "The new research will agitate the debate over ", ": Does the consumption of saturated fats —the ones characteristic of meat and dairy products  — contribute to heart disease?", "It is, without doubt, an important question. Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, and Americans eat a lot of red meat and dairy foods.", "The federal government has long blamed saturated fats for health troubles, and it continues — through the Dietary Guidelines for Americans — to recommend that people limit their intake.", "Indeed, the Dietary Guidelines continue to embrace the principles advocated by the Minnesota researchers from 40 years ago. The book advises Americans to limit their intake of saturated fats  and to replace them at least in part with oils, just as the Minnesota experimenters did 40 years ago. More specifically, it advises Americans to consume about five teaspoons (27 grams) of oils per day, mentioning canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean and sunflower oils.", "“Oils should replace solid fats rather than being added to the diet,” it advises.", "But the idea that spurning saturated fat will, by itself, make people healthier has never been fully proved, and in recent years repeated clinical trials and large-scale observational studies have produced evidence to the contrary. Whether cutting saturated fats out of your diet will make you healthier depends, of course, on what you replace them with.", "“What this research implies is that there is not enough evidence to draw strong conclusions about the health effects of vegetable oils” Christopher Ramsden, a medical investigator at NIH and a lead author of the study, said in an interview. While urging caution in drawing conclusions about the new analysis, he said the research suggested saturated fats \"may not be as bad as originally thought.\"", "Ramsden and colleagues discovered the missing data during their research examining the potentially harmful effects of linoleic acid — a key constituent of most vegetable oils — on human health. Preliminary research suggests a link between linoleic acid and diseases such as chronic pain, Ramsden said, and humans have been consuming it in larger quantities than their bodies may be prepared for. Before the advent of agriculture, humans got 2 to 3 percent of their calories from linoleic acid, according to the new paper; today most Americans, awash in cooking oils and oils added to snack foods, get much more.", "***", "It's not exactly clear why the full set of data from the Minnesota experiment was never published.", "As research efforts on diets go, the study was rigorous. Funded by the U.S. Public Health Service and the National Heart Institute, it involved more than 9,000 patients who were randomly assigned to one of the two diets.  Detailed measurements of blood cholesterol and other indexes of health were recorded.", "Willett, the Harvard nutritionist, faulted the experiment because many of the patients were on the special diets for relatively brief periods - many were being released from the mental institutions. But about a quarter of the patients remained on the diet for a year or longer, and why such an apparently well-done study received so little fanfare is mystifying to some.", "The results of the study were never touted by the investigators. Partial results were presented at an American Heart Association conference in 1975, and it wasn't until 1989 that some of the results were published, appearing in a medical journal known as Arteriosclerosis.", "The lead investigators of the trial, noted scientists Ancel Keys and Ivan Frantz, are deceased.", "Steven Broste, now a retired biostatistician, was then a student at the University of Minnesota and used the full set of data for his master's thesis in 1981. He interacted with the researchers. Part of the problem, Broste suggested in an interview, may have been limits on statistical methods at the time. Computer software for statistics wasn't as readily available as it is today. So, at the time of the study, it wasn't as easy to know how significant the data was. Broste completed his thesis several years after the last patients had left the trial, but it was not published in a journal.", "Broste also suggested that at least part of the reason for the incomplete publication of the data might have been human nature. The Minnesota investigators had a theory that they believed in — that reducing blood cholesterol would make people healthier. Indeed, the idea was widespread and would soon be adopted by the federal government in the first dietary recommendations.

She has examined election-year speech before, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great.", "But in the past week, with Trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him, his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups, she said.", "Benesch, 52, has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech. To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true:", "“Trump’s speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,” Benesch said in a recent interview. “The meaning is so often ambiguous.”", "But when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, “it seems to me impossible that people didn’t understand that as a reference to violence,” she said. Or when he suggested that Clinton and President Obama were founders of the Islamic State, something he alluded to again at Wednesday’s final debate, that was a “hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in-group member as the enemy,” she said.", "And now, with Trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him, he’s definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting. Direct incitement of violence is illegal, but Trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience.", "Because of that, it’s still a gray area that surrounds whether Trump does use dangerous speech.", "“Trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy,” Benesch said. “Some of them — those who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messages — may therefore be more likely to commit violence. However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americans’ belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.”", "Still, that she’s getting the question so often is in itself stunning.", "“I didn’t imagine that so soon after beginning this work I’d be asked to explain it to someone abroad who would want me to describe a case study,” she said, “and choose a case study in my own country.”", "On an unseasonably warm fall afternoon, Benesch sat barefoot on the stone steps outside her townhouse on a tree-lined street in Washington’s popular Logan Circle neighborhood. Inside, a young researcher was hunched over a laptop at her kitchen table. Her home is also the headquarters for her Dangerous Speech Project, which was born out of research grants she received from the MacArthur Foundation.", "Outside the kitchen window is a massive vegetable garden she built on the roof of her garage. Her home, an eclectic mix of mismatched furniture and art, doubles as an “eco-friendly community arts space” that features local musicians at a monthly dinner party she hosts.", "Benesch, who was born and raised in New York City, said she comes from a lineage of “immigrants, refugees and people who were killed because other people had been taught to hate them,” but that’s all the personal detail she will divulge. She is eager to discuss her work, but, perhaps because she is an expert in speech, is precise in what she shares, careful not to make generalizations or overstatements. ", "She credits spending much of her adult life immersed in the mass atrocities people commit against one another all over the world — first as a foreign correspondent for the Miami Herald in Latin America and then as a human rights lawyer — for her drive to understand why and how people turn to violence.", "As a young lawyer, she did international work in the aftermath of the ethnic conflicts in Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s. As they pored over whom to prosecute for the terrible crimes, Benesch was drawn to the question of whether one could detect warning signs for genocide before one occurred. People do not wake up in the morning and simultaneously decide to kill their neighbors, she thought.", "This question resurfaced several years later when she was teaching a clinic at Georgetown’s law school representing refugees in asylum cases. As she and her students worked to help people piece their shattered lives back together, she began thinking anew about whether there was a way to foresee the crises that created refugees.", "It was around that time that two good friends asked her, in the course of casual conversations, what she would do if she had one full year to work on anything she wanted without any concern for finances. Her answer came easily: She wanted to figure out whether someone could identify the kind of rhetoric that brought about social conflicts, and then whether someone could interfere with it without suppressing freedom of speech. In other words, could genocide be thwarted by simply drawing attention to the “dangerous speech” that precedes it?", "“I’ve learned a few specific things about humanity,” Benesch said. “First, people do not hate spontaneously. No one is born hating, or wanting to see or do violence. Also, no particular group — religious, ethnic, cultural or national — has a monopoly on dangerous speech. It isn’t that there is something wrong with one group or another, as some have alleged. All people are capable of producing and being influenced by dangerous speech. I see that as an opportunity.”", "For Benesch, it’s important that people understand that the type of speech she wants to counter is different from hate speech, which she says is a broad category for which there is no agreed-upon definition. An advocate for free speech, she does not believe that hate speech can or should be silenced. In fact, it’s one of the central reasons she sought to differentiate dangerous speech.", "There’s no way to say definitively when speech led to genocide or mass atrocities, because there are many contributing factors, or conversely whether Benesch’s efforts to counter that speech has succeeded in quelling what would have otherwise been a mass violence situation. But she has anecdotal evidence that leads her to believe that both are significant factors.", "After the results of the 2007 presidential election in Kenya were disputed, there were attacks that left more than 1,000 people dead and 500,000 displaced. In the lead-up to it, political leaders used incendiary language about other ethnic and tribal groups. One group, for example, said that those in another were like weeds that needed to be pulled out so “there would be only one tribe here,” Benesch ", "Benesch did her first field study for the Dangerous Speech Project in Kenya leading up to its next presidential election, held in March 2013. While there she helped oversee several projects that sought to diminish the impact of dangerous speech, including one writing four episodes of a popular Kenyan courtroom comedy in which the actors discredited inflammatory statements. The 2013 election produced little violence.", "She is continuing to study how to effectively respond to dangerous speech. Right now, she’s looking at the impact that shaming the speakers or using humor to minimize them may have.", "Her work has inspired others to take up the cause. This year the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum ", ", and its author credits Benesch as the inspiration for it.", "Rob Faris, director of the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard, where Benesch is a faculty associate, described her work as “innovative” in how it attempts to delegitimize dangerous speech rather than try to stifle it, thus protecting freedom of speech.", "Her framework is still intended to discourage large incidents of violence. While she has tested some theories on dangerous speech online, her strategies are unlikely to weed out lone mass shooters or even terrorist recruits because they’re too isolated.", "“In any given time, in any society there is a subset of people who hold extreme views and are willing to resort to violence, and I don’t think one can suppress that or expect to wipe it out,” Benesch said. “What I’m more concerned about is the large mass of people who are malleable, who can be influenced.”", "Despite seeing human viciousness up close, something she said she’ll never get used to, she is hopeful.", "“Hatred and fear and even mass atrocities are not at all new in human history — it’s the widespread efforts to push back against them, that are new, and when we step back and take a longer view, we can see that these efforts are working in many contexts and many places,” she said. “Humans are now much less likely to die at the hands of another human than in the past. There is far more work to do, and the daily headlines are often distressing and discouraging, but I can also see, paraphrasing Dr. Martin Luther King, that the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward peace.”", "Follow the latest on the outbreak with our newsletter every weekday.

We can’t eradicate racial bias, but, after reading the study’s conclusion and talking with mental health professionals, I see hope. Here are some steps that experts say parents of black sons can take:", "Amber Hewitt, a licensed psychologist in Washington, said providing black children with an appreciation and understanding of what it means to be black in America helps buffer the harmful effects of societal racism. “Black parents who provide their children with messages about cultural pride report less psychological distress for their children,” says Hewitt. While her practice has included research and clinical expertise in identity development, resilience, and racial socialization of black boys and young men, she emphasizes that black girls should not be overlooked when discussing sociocultural obstacles. “It is true that there are differences in how black boys and black girls experience the world and how society perceives and treats them,” she says. “However, I think we should be more inclusive when discussing experiences of black youth since there is a shared group experience.”", "Of course, identity development can be a lot more difficult to achieve when you have limited access to positive examples of individuals from similar backgrounds, or you are mostly exposed to the negative depictions that black boys and girls are shown of themselves in movies, TV and pop culture. “The portrayal of black boys and girls in mainstream media is often one that invalidates their experiences. For example, the presence of stereotypical roles and images (e.g., angry black woman, criminal, athlete, entertainer) found in many commercials, television shows, news programs, and other forms of media is a contextual factor that impacts positive identity development,” Hewitt says. In addition to exposure to positive role models, Hewitt believes that mentorship can provide an alternative to the narrow media examples that are shown to black youths.", "The “Race and Economic Opportunity Study” found that black boys whose fathers are present have better outcomes, and we know that having a father in the household can be a tool for identity development. However, that variable can be more difficult to control for. Thankfully, the study added that for boys without a father in the home, living in a neighborhood with present black fathers and being mentored by other black men provides a good substitute.", "Erlanger Turner, assistant professor at the University of Houston-Downtown and faculty affiliate with its Center for Critical Race Studies, agrees. “In my experience, black males that have black male mentors are more confident and self-assured when they can see themselves in certain careers. If you know someone who has achieved what you want to pursue it gives them more hope.”", "Hewitt believes mentorship can also build emotional strength. “Mentoring can help develop resilience. The contemporary view of resilience emphasizes the relationship between the individual and their environment and how individuals navigate systems to acquire the resources needed to overcome adversity,” she says. “This approach underscores the importance of self-definition and self-agency. In other words, it is important for black youth to be able to define themselves positively despite an environment that is not affirming of their identity.”", "It’s important for parents of black children to be mindful of the environment they raise their children in, if they have the option. According to the researchers, growing up in a diverse neighborhood with low racial bias produced black boys who do better in school and in life. Residing in affluent neighborhoods often comes with its own challenges and isn’t necessarily the best environment to raise a black child. “Living in a so-called affluent area does not mean that the child will be protected from racial bias. It could be that the child experiences more bias and discrimination in more subtle, covert ways like microaggressions,” explains Hewitt.", "Turner also points out that putting our children in areas where they are the only child of color can affect their sense of accomplishment later in life. “One potential consequence is experiencing what is referred to as the impostor phenomenon — the inability to internalize success or feeling like you’re not deserving of success. Studies have shown that impostor feelings are associated with risk of depression and anxiety.”", "After reading the study and talking to Hewitt and Turner, I have mixed feelings about the results. I’d especially like to know which of these buffers yields the most benefits for black children — the researchers aren’t sure. Like most black parents, my husband and I can’t control for everything. We’re a military family currently living in an overwhelmingly conservative and white town, and we regularly see a truck with a large Confederate flag near our neighborhood. Racial bias is inescapable. At the same time, my husband and I serve as alternative images of blackness, when compared to media portrayals. We plan to continue doing what is best for our son and hope what we accomplish makes up for what was out of our reach.

This excess weight contributes to a variety of health problems. Despite enormous effort over decades, the problem has proved extremely difficult to solve. Biologist Satchin Panda thinks we’re missing a key variable: Instead of focusing so much on what we eat, he says, we should pay more attention to when we eat.", "A researcher at the Salk Institute in San Diego, Panda argues that eating within a certain time window each day can help people lose weight and may help prevent illnesses including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In animal studies, he and others have shown that limiting food intake to a period of eight to 12 hours can boost cognitive and physical performance, and may even lengthen life span. Known as time-restricted feeding, or TRF, the approach is simple: Eat more or less what you want, but don’t consume anything before or after the allotted time.", "Panda argues that humans’ circadian rhythm is not designed for a world with 24-7 access to food. “If you’re eating all the time, it messes up that pattern,” he says. For many if not most Americans, that pattern is deeply out of whack, and many of us eat from early morning until late at night.", "It is not clear whether TRF works in humans the way it seems to work in lab mice. For one, mice and humans have very different circadian rhythms. Mice are nocturnal and sleep more than once a day. They also live for only two or three years. “It may be that for a mouse, a 16-hour fast is the equivalent of a two- or three-day fast for a human,” says Courtney Peterson, a nutrition scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who is doing research on TRF in humans.", "In addition, Peterson and others say, some of the benefits of TRF may stem from decreased consumption due to the shortened eating window: It’s not really surprising that cutting out the after-dinner drink and the late-night sundae is good for weight loss and overall health. And, in fact, studies in humans and animals have found that TRF helps both mice and people eat fewer calories.", "Panda first got interested in TRF 15 years ago, while studying the genetics of circadian rhythm. His research on mice revealed that over the course of a day, hundreds of liver genes turn on and off cyclically. The liver plays a central role in metabolizing calories, and it turned out that most of these cyclic genes were involved in eating and digestion. This led him to ask whether mice — and humans, too — were programmed to eat according to a certain circadian schedule. In 2008, he began examining how mice responded to different feeding schedules; to his surprise, TRF had powerful ", ".", "The researchers compared two groups of mice, both of which consumed the same number of calories. One group was limited to an eight-hour window, while the other could eat at any time. After four months, the eight-hour mice weighed 28 percent less than the anytime eaters. “When we saw the results, they were so unexpected,” he says. “Even I didn’t believe it.”", "He had his students independently repeat the experiment three times; all of the results were similar. Using the same model — two groups eating an equal number of calories, but on different feeding schedules — he ", " that TRF mice had normal blood sugar levels, while the unlimited-schedule animals developed Type 2 diabetes. Since then, he has shown that TRF can reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. In addition, mice restricted to an eight- or nine-hour eating window could run for twice as long as those that ate on a normal schedule.", "“TRF is an interesting and valuable idea, but it’s not proven that it works in humans,” says nutrition researcher David Allison, dean of the University of Indiana School of Public Health. “There is some evidence to suggest that it might be useful for some things. But it’s extraordinarily complex to actually nail this down.”", "Overall, he says, the evidence indicates that eating most of your food earlier in the day is probably healthier than eating most of your food later in the day. He also notes that there are many complexities to the issue, including the fact that most people eat healthier food at breakfast (oatmeal or cereal, for instance) than they do at dinner (hamburger, fries and dessert).", "Some evidence from research involving humans indicates that TRF has benefits even when people don’t eat any less. In a study that is soon to be published, Peterson examined eight men with pre-diabetes, a condition in which people are close to being diabetic but not quite there. Researchers prepared all food in the study, and the participants ate it under supervision. The men tried two schedules: eating all their meals between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., and between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Compared with the 12-hour schedule, the six-hour window significantly lowered blood pressure and improved insulin sensitivity, the ability to process glucose.", "“We were really excited about the results,” Peterson says. “It was a small study, but it was done extremely carefully.” In a similar study, also not yet published, she looked at 11 overweight people who followed the same two regimens. Although those in the six-hour window did not increase the overall number of calories they burned, they did increase the amount of fat they burned and reduced levels of a key hunger hormone called ghrelin; these metabolic changes might make it easier to lose weight and body fat.", "“I think that within 10 years we will have some really clear guidelines for meal timing,” Peterson says. “But we are in the early stages of this research. There is a lot more work we need to do.”", "In 2015, Panda ", " of 156 adults; more than half spread food consumption over 15 hours or longer, while only 10 percent consistently ate within a 12-hour window. He followed up with eight of these people, who were overweight and typically ate for 14 hours or more a day. When the subjects were limited to a 10-hour window for four months, with no other restrictions — they could eat whatever they wanted — they lost weight, slept better and had more energy.", "Panda is now starting a study that will eventually include thousands of adults worldwide. Using a custom smartphone app that allows people to take photos of what they eat and immediately send them to researchers, he will be able to more accurately track which foods people eat. Using this data, he will examine whether TRF can improve weight, blood sugar, blood pressure, joint pain, sleep, anxiety and inflammation.", "Panda says that mice and humans — and probably most organisms — are not built to simultaneously ingest food and metabolize it. “Everything cannot happen at once,” Panda says. “The body can’t take in calories and break down calories at the same time.” He and other circadian scientists say that many if not most animals have evolved to consume food according to the 24-hour solar cycle. For humans, this rhythm involves eating during the day and sleeping after sunset. With the advent of electric lights, refrigerators, microwaves and 7-Elevens, millions if not billions of us have jettisoned this pattern. But the circadian rhythm of our metabolism still expects us to stop eating at sundown. This mismatch between modern society and programmed biology can lead to myriad health problems, Panda and others say.", "It is not clear exactly how TRF works, but it seems to trigger several molecular changes. It increases the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body; it boosts levels of ketone bodies, molecules produced by the liver during fasting, which are a powerful source of energy and are especially useful to muscle and brain cells; it also raises production of brown fat, the “good” fat that helps the body burn more energy. Together, these mechanisms allow the body to generate more energy and metabolize calories more efficiently than unscheduled eating.", "TRF is just one of several approaches that involve fasting. Scientists are also looking at intermittent fasting, which typically involves eating every other day, or eating for five days and then fasting for two.", "Valter Longo, a gerontologist at the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, has focused on an approach in which people eat very little for five days at a time, several times a year. Other researchers are examining calorie restriction, which requires reducing calorie intake below normal levels, for months, years or longer, in hopes of triggering a variety of beneficial physiological responses. Studies of animals and humans have found that these regimens can have benefits, including weight loss, lower rates of cancer, diabetes and heart disease, and, in some animal studies, significantly longer life span.", "All of these strategies have some similarities to TRF, Panda says, with one major difference: They are much more difficult to follow. Whereas TRF involves relatively minor adjustments in how most people already eat, intermittent fasting and calorie restriction often require hunger and discipline for long periods.", "This, he says, is why TRF has potential as a public health strategy. In a society where Big Gulps and Big Macs are ubiquitous, unhealthy eating and obesity are very hard to avoid. TRF, Panda contends, offers a simple, relatively manageable alternative. “Just by changing when we eat, we can have an effect on obesity and these related problems,” Panda says. “This can really move the needle.”", "Panda himself has adopted TRF and says he’s seen benefits: lower blood sugar, weight loss, better sleep and more energy. He now uses a modified version, in which he eats breakfast at 7 a.m., skips lunch and has dinner with his family at around 7 p.m. In essence, he has two long fasts a day, between meals and overnight. Others around him have adopted the classic TRF regimen, including his 15-year-old daughter, his mother and several graduate students in his lab. He says his mother had pre-diabetes before starting the diet; since then, her blood sugar has dropped significantly, to a healthy level.", "So far, TRF has not caught on widely. Peterson, the UAB scientist, is one of the early adopters. Five to seven days a week, she limits her consumption to a six- or seven-hour window, usually eating between 8 a.m. and 2 or 3 p.m. She says she has more energy, feels a bit calmer and doesn’t feel particularly hungry in the afternoon or evening.", "“You have to adapt to it,” she says. “When I first started trying this, I found 10 hours was hard.

AFDC entitled families below the poverty line to income support for so long as they remained poor. All states had to follow the same federal rules, even though the amount of support differed by state based on local economic conditions.", "TANF was different. It offers support to poor families and their children for up to five years, but only if they could show that they’ve tried to find work. After five years, people are dropped from the program. States could change all these guidelines, within limits — kicking recipients off sooner or later, giving more or less in cash benefits, altering the work requirements, and adding more conditions such as being drug-free.", "Caseloads dropped dramatically, although it’s not as clear ", " as well. Much of the ", " in the past 20 years has been over how to measure welfare reform’s overall effects. But because states had so much leeway in how to put TANF into place, welfare reform affected various racial and ethnic groups differently — in some cases, in ways that shored up ", ".", "In ", ", we show that legal immigrants — a group that includes large numbers of Latinos and Asians — were especially hurt by welfare reform. In particular, their children were less likely to graduate high school.", "After 1996, many immigrants lost eligibility for benefits, because TANF removed federal subsidies during immigrants’ first five years  as legal permanent residents. (Undocumented immigrants were never eligible for these programs.)", "A lot of the ", " came from this exclusion.

So to check our findings, ", ", we compared something slightly different.", "Using data from the Current Population Survey, we looked more closely at how individuals’ chances of graduating changed over time, comparing the chance a young, low-income immigrant had of graduating from high school in the periods before (1994-1995) and after reform (2003-2004) in states that did, and did not, offer TANF to immigrants.", "When we looked at individuals and their family’s eligibility, we found that in states that allowed low-income immigrants to receive benefits, non-citizen children’s chance of graduating grew faster than in the states that did not.", "Unlike the first study, in which we included all children of immigrants regardless of their own citizenship status, thereby including some youths who were themselves eligible for benefits, in this study we focused on children who were foreign-born.", "Our results were similar to those from the first study. Only low-income Latino and Asian youths were affected: children who live in immigrant households or in communities with high proportions of immigrants.", "Take, for example, a newly arriving, low-income immigrant who would have been directly affected by ineligibility. That young person was 17 points less likely to graduate from high school if he or she lived in a state whose TANF program excluded new permanent residents than in a state that included new permanent residents.", "What’s more, that state restriction affected not just the legal permanent resident children from low-income families who hadn’t been in the United States long enough to be eligible for TANF; it also affected those children who had been in the United States long enough to qualify for the program. Even for a low-income immigrant youth who had been in legal permanent residency status for more than five years and thus eligible for TANF, the probability of graduation was still eight points lower in states with the exclusion.", "Social science calls that a spillover effect; it’s a common ", " of policies that target immigrant groups.", "These results aren’t linked to other differences between the two kinds of states, TANF-restrictive and TANF-inclusive. For example, the gap doesn’t appear to be due to other variations in state welfare laws, such as caps on how many children a family could cover, or time limits on receiving TANF.", "We checked this by comparing different ethnic groups. All low-income youths in a state experience the general restrictions the state puts in place, but immigrant eligibility restrictions affect only immigrants and others in their families and communities. States’ decisions about immigrant eligibility had no effect on the graduation rates of low-income, native-born, black or white youths, who weren’t subject to the restriction and weren’t likely to experience spillover effects.", "Why would being excluded from social welfare programs lead some children of immigrants to drop out of high school? There are a number of reasons. Without the income from TANF, parents may need to work longer hours, leaving kids unsupervised. Children may have to work to help their families, reducing the time and energy they have for school.", "But beyond the material reasons are psychological effects of being treated as if you do — or don’t — belong. Developmental psychologists have argued that children’s behaviors and attitudes are shaped by social context. Being excluded from welfare may signal second-class status — and being included may signal that you are welcome.

In March 1992, Trump’s Castle and Plaza casinos also filed for bankruptcy. Later that year, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan also filed for bankruptcy.", "In all four cases, Trump settled by giving up nearly half of his equity shares to lenders.

Theoretically, that would have made him eligible under a related federal tax provision to minimize income taxes.", "Some have suggested that Trump might have used the new public company to shed the tax liability.", "Karen Burke, a law professor at the University of Florida, said these and other possibilities are entirely legal if properly invoked.

When other countries are welcoming far more refugees, the U.S. should be ashamed for using jails and even contemplating large-scale deportation tactics.”", "Groups that have called for stricter immigration limits said the raids are long overdue and remained skeptical about whether the scale would be large enough to deter future illegal immigration from Central America.", "“I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “What share is this going to be?. . . It’s a drop in the bucket compared to the number they’ve admitted into the country. If you have photogenic raids on a few dozen illegal families and that’s the end of it, it’s just for show. It’s just a [public relations] thing, enforcement theater.”", "Marsha Catron, a DHS spokeswoman, would not comment on any possible ICE operations but pointed out that Johnson “has consistently said our border is not open to illegal immigration, and if individuals come here illegally, do not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have final orders of removal, they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our values.”", "The raids could become a flash point on the 2016 campaign trail, where GOP presidential contenders, including front-runner Donald Trump, have made calls for stricter border control a central issue. Trump’s rise has come as he has promised to deport all undocumented immigrants and bar entry to the United States for Muslim refugees in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., policy prescriptions denounced by Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton. ", "The immigration issue has often bedeviled Obama, who came into office under pressure from supporters to end the George W. Bush administration’s post-Sept. 11, 2001, crackdown on illegal migrants. Instead, the administration increased deportations in its early years, drawing repeated fire from Latino groups and immigration advocates. Then, in summer 2014, came the surge of children flocking across the southwest border.", "While most public attention focused on minors who were crossing the border alone, the number of children who came with a family member — known as “family units’’ in DHS parlance — also spiked dramatically.", "With the government overwhelmed at first, many of the families were simply released and told to appear at later immigration court dates to determine if they would be granted asylum.", "Some never showed up or had their asylum claims rejected and were ordered deported by immigration judges, officials familiar with the process said. That population is among those expected to be targeted in the upcoming raids, they said.", " Immigrant rights advocates and legal experts say the families and minors were in many cases not granted adequate representation and were confused by the asylum procedures in court.", "DHS, meanwhile, reacted to the surge by opening family detention centers, two in Texas and one in Pennsylvania. Those centers now house more than 1,700 people, DHS officials said Wednesday. But even as DHS officials have long vowed that the migrants will be treated humanely, their advocates have said conditions are crowded and inhumane in the centers, which often house women with children.", "As the administration wrestled with how to handle the families, Johnson in November 2014 issued a set of new immigration enforcement priorities. Much of the attention focused on his public statements that undocumented immigrants who had been in the country for years should be integrated into society rather than deported. And Obama, on the same day, announced an executive action intended to shield up to 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation.", "But Obama’s action has been blocked in the courts. And Johnson has also made clear that families, children and others who had illegally crossed the border recently and did not obtain asylum status — and anyone ordered deported starting on Jan. 1, 2014 — would be subject to removal. ", "DHS “will also continue to expedite, to the greatest extent possible, the removal of those who are not eligible for relief under our laws,’’ Johnson said in a September statement about the family detention centers. “We take seriously our obligation to secure our borders.’’", " In August, a federal judge in California ordered the administration to begin releasing in October children and family members from the detention centers. The judge said DHS had violated a 1990s consent decree that said minors taken into custody, whether accompanied by an adult or not, had to be treated humanely and allowed to quickly contest their incarcerations.", "The administration has said it is complying with the ruling, but it has also filed an appeal with a federal appeals court, and officials said the decision left them feeling hamstrung. “It doesn’t allow us to hold onto people, to detain them until we can deport them,’’ said one person familiar with the internal debate.", "Then, in recent months, the flow of families crossing the border suddenly shot up again. The numbers of family units apprehended rose 173 percent in October and November, compared to the same period last year, according to DHS data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. ", "The court decision and the sudden spike led to the decision to begin planning the upcoming raid, said officials familiar with the deliberations, who said DHS knows the deportations will be inflammatory but believes it must enforce the law."]},

But generally, card companies offer these protections and services for purchases made with that credit card.", "Consumers hoping to take advantage of these services may have to jump through a few hoops, such as providing copies of receipts, ads and other documents, says Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst for CreditCards.com. People can generally claim the benefits over the phone or online. On minor purchases, some people may not want to go through the hassle. But when the perks may lead to hundreds of dollars in savings, claiming them may be worth the extra steps, Schulz says. Here’s what consumers need to know:", "Few things are more frustrating than finding an item on sale days, or weeks, after you bought it. Many retailers offer refunds to people who can show that the item is now selling for a lower price there. Others may match the lower price offered by a competitor. But many credit cards will also match prices for cardholders, Schulz says. Consumers often need to show their original receipts and provide copies of ads, with dates, that show the lower price. Cards max out the refunds at $250 or $500 per item, according to ", " The claims must usually be made within 60 or 90 days of the purchase.", "Many credit cards offer insurance on items that are stolen or damaged within months of being purchased. The coverage typically kicks in for goods damaged by fire, smoke or water, with a few exceptions. Generally, cards will cover up to $500 per item or incident, with a maximum of $50,000 per year. The damage or theft must typically happen within 90 days or 120 days from the date of purchase, according to CardHub.com. In many cases, items stolen from a person’s car or damaged by a power surge will not be covered.", " Are you renting a car when you head to", "Grandma’s house for Thanksgiving?

For instance, antique and luxury cars are typically not covered. And American Express doesn’t cover rentals of certain types of SUVs, including the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and the Range Rover, according to CardHub.com. In many cases, people who already have car insurance will find that their coverage also applies for rental cars, but the protections offered by credit cards can help supplement that coverage, Papadimitriou says. Many card companies cap the time of rental car insurance at 30 or 31 days.", "Trying to decide whether to buy an extended warranty can typically add minutes, if not hours, of anxiety to a major purchase. People weigh the cost of the coverage against the chances that they will actually use it. (Lots of people never do.) But many credit cards offer extended warranties to consumers at no extra cost, Schulz says. The protection typically kicks in after the manufacturer warranty has expired, extending the coverage for another year or two. Items with manufacturer warranties that are longer than three years may be excluded. And, again, card companies usually require consumers to show copies of their receipts.", "Did you wait too long to return something? Some credit card companies will let you send in new or unworn items to them in exchange for a refund.

Only 28 percent of cardholders have asked to have a late payment fee waived, according to a survey by CreditCards.com. Some 23 percent of people polled have asked for a lower interest rate.

Addressing reporters at an economic summit, he accused the GOP of being “scared of widows and orphans” and punctuated the upbraiding by calling the party’s rhetoric a “potent recruitment tool” for the Islamic State.", "At its core, Obama’s fight with his political rivals is not just about refugees but about a broader sentiment among some Republicans that the president has consistently played down the threat posed by terrorist groups. Obama referred to the Islamic State as the “JV team”", " two years ago and suggested just hours before the group’s attacks in Paris on Friday, in which at least 129 people were killed, that his policies had “contained” it.", "Obama has used drone strikes to kill terrorists who pose a threat to the United States, even as he has worried that the threat posed by extremist groups has been consistently overstated, leading the United States to make costly foreign policy blunders and betray its core values. That tension between the president, who worries that Americans will over­react to the terrorism threat, and his opponents, who insist that his administration is minimizing or ignoring it, has persisted for years.", "In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, that tension has come to a head. Instead of uniting Americans to battle a ruthless enemy, the massacre in France has exposed deep rifts among political interests with vastly differing views of the terrorist threat and the proper response to it.", "“Some of them seem to think that if I were just more bellicose in expressing what we’re doing, that that would make a difference,” Obama said dismissively of his critics on Monday during a summit in Antalya, Turkey.", "But some argue that the president’s reaction was inappropriate to the moment. “It’s been a bloodless response,” said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a top adviser during Bill Clinton’s presidency. “At one point, he used the word ‘setback,’ which is amazingly unresponsive to the emotionality of these events.”", "As he has proceeded on his nine-day trip — the last stop will be in Malaysia on Friday — Obama has wearily defended his strategy against the Islamic State, saying time and again that he will not change course after Paris. Obama’s extended rebuke of the GOP over the migrant crisis represents an effort to broaden the debate and turn the criticism back on his political adversaries.

Denying desperate migrants entry to the United States will not keep Americans safer, he said.

And that’s the point.”", "To Obama, the GOP’s turn to military force to resolve disputes helped bring about the instability in the Middle East. He has pointed to times he has authorized the use of force, including the killing of Osama bin Laden and the decision this year to leave more U.S. troops in Afghanistan next year than were initially committed.", "But Obama also has made a priority of relying on other elements of American power and diplomacy to demonstrate leadership, build partnerships and extract concessions from adversaries.", "On his trip, Obama has touted a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact, U.S. support for recent democratic elections in Burma and collaboration with China on climate change as evidence that his policies are paying dividends. He has staked much of his Middle East legacy on the Iran nuclear deal and defied many Republican leaders by restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba.", "It is the criticism of his policies on the migrant crisis, however, that has drawn the strongest reaction from the president this week. “Yeah, I’ve got some comments on that,” he said Wednesday before a reporter had finished her question.", "Obama acknowledged that Paris, with its cafes and public parks and sports stadiums, reminds Americans of their own way of life, so that the attacks were perhaps more acutely felt in the United States than other Islamic State atrocities were. But, he said, “we are not well served when in response to a terrorist attack we descend into fear and panic. We don’t make good decisions if it’s based on hysteria or an exaggeration of risks.”", "He added that “when candidates say, ‘We wouldn’t admit 3-year-old orphans,’ that’s political posturing. When individuals say that we should have a religious test and that only Christians — proven Christians — should be admitted, that’s offensive and contrary to American values.”", "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) said Wednesday that he would welcome Syrian refugees, rejecting calls by more than two dozen governors who said they oppose the settlement of refugees in their states. Inslee cited a need not to give in to the kind of fear that gripped Americans after Japan’s World War II attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to the establishment of internment camps for Japanese Americans.", "“We regret that.

Prairie voles possess many more of this hormone's receptors in the brain as compared to promiscuous montane voles — a free-wheeling species with no interest in settling down. However, increasing the number of receptors in the brain of a male montane vole quickly turns him into a one-female-only type of partner.", "Based on these findings from animal studies, Zietsch and his colleagues tested a subset of subjects for links between cheating and the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A gene (AVPR1A), which encodes the protein that acts as a receptor for vasopressin.

She keeps calling me, and I tell her to be assertive about her rights, but there are a lot of gray areas and strong cultural feelings that you have to obey your parents. It can be very hard to define abuse.”", "In many such families, disputes over early marriage can be part of broader generational conflicts in which Asian-born parents seek to control and protect their Western-raised daughters, who yearn for modern freedoms such as dating boys, staying out late, and wearing makeup and party clothes.", "But advocates at Tahirih and other agencies said they have made few inroads into family counseling or public education within immigrant communities, partly because of cultural resistance and partly because they place a higher priority on rescuing or protecting the young women who call their hotlines for help.", "“Many times, families are not interested in intervention,” said Usha Amachandran, who runs a women’s aid program in San Francisco. “In the South Asian community, no one wants to talk about things like domestic violence or forced marriage. But we are in the business of talking about uncomfortable things, and it is very much needed.”", "In Washington last week, Mariam and several other young women performed skits at a Busboys and Poets cafe in the District that reflected their contradictory feelings about parental demands.

They may still be tempted to arrange illegal cross-border visits, but they have more to lose now if they get caught, because it would jeopardize their new legal status and their ability to support the children they have here.", "“This will not reunite families,” said Andrea Rodriguez, a lawyer at the Central American Resource Center in the District, which has begun offering workshops explaining Obama’s latest action and preparing immigrants to apply. It is widely expected that even those who qualify will only be able to travel home with special one-time permission, usually granted for emergencies.", "“People may no longer have to miss a parent’s funeral or hospitalization,” Rodriguez said. “But for those who have been separated for years from their parents or children, and simply want to reconnect with them, it is not going to be possible. There will still be that worry and stress.”", "This realization has begun to dampen the mood of jubilant relief that flooded immigrant communities last month after Obama’s announcement, which will allow several million people with U.S.-born children to work and live here legally for the first time. Most of them have parents back home, and many left older children behind as well.", "Rosa Pelaez, 32, an immigrant from Mexico who lives in the District, said she is thrilled that she and her husband, Juan Flores, who have four U.S.-born children, will probably qualify for three-year protection. After almost 15 years in the United States, both expect to be able to live and work legally for the first time, without fear of being caught and deported.", "But Obama’s action will not grant Pelaez her dearest wish: to see her father again. Until this month, she was under the mistaken impression that the executive action would allow her to travel to Mexico, where she left home as a teenager and where her dad, now an ailing widower, lives alone in the same house.", "“I know my father is lonely. All these years working here, I’ve helped him pay to put light and water in his house, but I have never been able to see him,” said Pelaez, 32. She held out a blurry snapshot of a gray-haired man, standing next to a cinder-block shack surrounded by banana plants. “Now they say I still can’t go visit him unless it’s for his funeral.”", "Two years ago, when Obama announced a similar executive action granting temporary deportation relief to about 700,000 illegal immigrant youths, known as dreamers, the issue of family reunification was not as dire. Some dreamers grew up in the United States without their parents, but many came to the United States as children with older family members.", "This time, though, many of the families who qualify for the president’s protection are the same kinds of families whose children, left behind in El Salvador or Honduras, surged across the U.S.-Mexico border this year after their parents — anxious to save them from gang violence or just longing to be with them — paid smugglers to bring them north.", "So far, no one is predicting that Obama’s latest action will prompt a new wave of border arrivals, and immigrant advocates note that parents who qualify for his plan will have much more at stake if they attempt to travel illegally, including work permits, some health benefits and a possible path to permanent residency.", "The government has not yet published the final rules for Obama’s plan, but immigration experts expect they will be almost identical to those issued with the 2012 executive action that established the “", "” program, or DACA.", "Like other forms of temporary protection for illegal immigrants, DACA did not confer the right to travel. Under U.S. law, even those granted relief from deportation are still considered illegal, and they can only leave the country legally by applying for a one-time emergency travel document called “", ".” Immigration officials have full discretion whether to approve or deny such requests, and often they are denied.", " ", "Several immigrant parents who left their children back home, dismayed to learn that Obama’s latest action would not allow them to travel, said they would still consider having their children smuggled north. Isabel Cruz, 38, a Salvadoran restaurant worker in Maryland, said she worries constantly about her two sons back home, especially since the older one was recently beaten by gang members.", "“If the new law won’t let us find a way to be together, maybe I will have to take the risk and start sending for them,” said Cruz, who has a younger child born in the United States. “It is not safe for them in my country.”", "Others with children here to care for said they would rather remain separated from loved ones than risk the hazards of illegal travel. Maria Muñoz, 26, a dishwasher in the District, said she misses her parents in El Salvador but has built her plans firmly around her daughter, Andrea, 2, who was born in the United States. She expects to apply for deferred deportation in the spring.", "“My greatest dream is to go home and see my family, but even if I get the chance, I would come right back,” said Muñoz, who has been in the United States for eight years. As she spoke, she tried to hold her squirming daughter while eating a plate of tacos in a Mexican cafe. “I want her to be a prepared person, to go to an American university,” Muñoz said. “In this life, you have to choose between the past and the future.”", "According to instructions issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for DACA recipients, travel requests may be granted for any of three purposes: humanitarian needs, such as medical treatment or a family funeral; educational opportunities, such as exchange programs; and employment requirements, such as attending conferences.", "Applicants who meet the travel criteria must pay a fee of $360 and wait, often for weeks, while immigration officials decide whether to approve the trip. “Travel for vacation,” the instructions add dryly, “is not a valid basis for advance parole.”", "Patrick Taurel, a lawyer with the American Immigration Council in the District, said his nonprofit agency has been urging immigration officials to broaden the definition of “humanitarian” travel to include family reunions. “To visit a close family member you haven’t seen in years, isn’t that a humanitarian purpose?” Taurel asked. “This is a very important and dear issue to a lot of people.”", "Rodriguez, who conducted a workshop this week on how to apply for deportation relief, said that immigration officials have been granting more permissions lately for trips they deemed “important,” and that at least one DACA student was approved for a college exchange trip back to El Salvador. “It doesn’t hurt to try,” she said.", "Citizenship and Immigration Services officials provided the current rules for advance parole but declined to comment on any plans to change those guidelines.", "For Pelaez, the yearning to go home and take care of her ailing father in Mexico has been increasingly overshadowed by her responsibilities as the mother of three children in elementary school and a newborn, all U.S. citizens. Her husband, Flores, 40, a grounds­keeper, has not seen his mother in 20 years, but he is focused on a different goal through Obama’s action: obtaining a work permit and finally asking for a raise.", "In the couple’s tiny apartment in the District one night this week, a jumble of children and pets cavorted on several mattresses crammed into one room, while Pelaez kept a semblance of order. With 8-week-old Sebastian napping on her chest, she rummaged through an album of old family photos from Mexico, full of hammocks and chickens and barefoot kids.", "“We were so poor back then. Life is much better here,” she said. Across the room, her two older sons huddled excitedly over an iPad, playing a race-car game and chattering away in English. Her daughter came in, wearing a smart plaid school uniform, and picked up the family cat. As Pelaez looked around the room, it was clear that she had already made her choice."]},

A Maytag washer and dryer: $1,999 over 100 weeks.", "Abbott wanted a love seat-sofa combo, and she knew it might rip her budget. But this, she figured, was the cost of being out of options. “You don’t get something like that just to put more burden on yourself,” Abbott said.", "Five years into a national economic recovery that has further strained the poor working class, an entire industry has grown around handing them a lifeline to the material rewards of middle-class life.

The most striking change in the world of low-income commerce has been the proliferation of rent-to-own stores such as Buddy’s Home Furnishings, which has been opening a new store every week, largely in the South.", "In some ways, the business harkens back to the subprime boom of the early 2000s, when lenders handed out loans to low-income", "borrowers with little credit history. But while people in those days were charged perhaps an interest rate of 5 to 10 percent, at rental centers the poor find themselves paying effective annual interest rates of more than 100 percent.

If he could keep up the pace, they’d be okay.", "Inside", "Buddy’s, Abbott walked over to a brown Ashley Furniture model, something she and her husband agreed would fit the colors of their Buccaneer trailer.

As recently as 2007, Buddy’s — private, family-run — was essentially a Florida-based company. But as the first mortgages starting going bust, Buddy’s saw 6,000 products returned over several weeks, Gazzo said. The initial goal of expansion, Gazzo said, was less about domination than survival: Buddy’s wanted to get away from Florida, the epicenter of the real estate bubble.", "The company found itself with a thriving strategy almost by accident.

You have to work hard and move fast and be careful,” said the stocky crew chief, an immigrant from El Salvador. “I have never seen an American do this work.” ¶At a Baltimore employment center, Keith Bellisaire, 40, proudly shared cellphone pictures of rooms he had painted on day jobs. He said he has not been able to land a full-time position in years. ¶“I’m ready to work, and I can work as hard as anyone. Sometimes I wonder if there is discrimination,” said Bellisaire, who is black. “I don’t think the Spanish people are trying to take away our jobs, but I wish I had more chances to show what I can do.” ¶In the battle over immigration reform, no issue is more contentious than whether low-skilled immigrants are displacing American-born workers or filling a vital economic gap by accepting jobs that many Americans are unwilling or unavailable to perform.", "The dispute pits business owners, who claim that they cannot find enough Americans to clean rooms or hang drywall, against labor leaders who are trying to protect U.S. jobs and wages, and conservatives, who want to restrict legal immigration and punish undocumented immigrants.", "On June 27, in a major compromise aimed at legalizing an estimated 11 million undocumented residents, the Senate passed an immigration bill that includes two new programs to raise the number of low-skilled foreign workers. ", "But when the House returns from recess next month, it is certain to reopen the divisive debate that almost scuttled the Senate effort. Business leaders are clamoring for more low-skilled visas, and labor groups are trying to limit them. Experts are updating reports to support arguments on both sides.

With wages stagnating in immigrant-heavy occupations, the report concluded that immigrants are pushing Americans out of jobs they would be willing to do for higher wages.", "The reality, however, is more complicated. According to some experts, the flood of Hispanic immigrant workers in the past 25 years — both legal and illegal — has had a much smaller effect on employment patterns than other trends, including factory flight overseas, weakened labor unions and a spate of recessions.", "They also say that low-skilled immigration has been both a boon and a burden to America. It has squeezed public services but generated tax revenue. It has depressed wages in some areas but has revitalized ailing communities. The group that suffers most from the influx of new foreign laborers, these experts report, are earlier immigrants.", "“We have to be honest here. Low-skilled immigration has costs, but it also has benefits,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. While some individuals and locations can be harmed, he said, the positive impact on the U.S. economy is unquestionable. And if illegal immigrants are brought into the mainstream, he predicted, “the playing field will level out.”", "Maple Lawn, the housing development where Alex Hernandez works, offers one window on both the economic calculus and cultural attitudes that have transformed many workplaces and industries that employ growing numbers of low-wage immigrants.", "One of the builders on the site is Mitchell & Best Homes. Many of its laborers, such as wood framers, are Latino, and site supervisor Michael Smith says the reason has more to do with work ethic than wages. Even at $20 per hour, he says, few U.S.-born workers apply.", "“Americans want more money, and Spanish will take less, but I don’t care if they’re white, black, Spanish or women. We just want good workers,” Smith said. “There’s a loyalty issue, too. The white workers want to leave right at 4 p.m., whether or not the work is done. The Hispanics will stay on until it’s finished.”", "Such comments are echoed by employers in other parts of the country. Jay Williams, vice president of a landscaping firm in Houston, said he advertises for 20 jobs each summer but that U.S.-born applicants usually quit after a few days. Without access to more temporary foreign workers, he said, such firms may resort to illegal immigrants. “We still need guys to dig holes and push wheelbarrows,” Williams said.", "Andrew Puzder, head of the California-based Hardee’s fast-food chain, said his business is a good fit for immigrants because they are willing to start at the bottom and work up.", "One of Puzder’s 70,000 U.S. employees is Jose Diaz, 31, who was born in Nicaragua and started frying burgers a decade ago in California. Today he manages a Hardee’s outlet in Stafford County, where his salary of about $40,000 is more than 12 times the per-capita income of his native land.", "“Immigrants appreciate what America offers,” Puzder said during a recent visit to Washington to lobby for immigration reform. “They are not taking jobs from Americans, because there are not sufficient Americans applying for jobs. Maybe they feel they have better options.”", "The Center for Immigration Studies, however, suggested that submissiveness rather than ambition makes low-skilled immigrants especially desirable. In a new report this month, it noted that many depend on their employers for visas and come from “docile, authority-fearing Third World populations,” making them easier to manage.", "Still, immigrants’ acceptance of low wages remains a major part of their appeal to profit-minded companies. Some economists assert that the flood of Hispanic workers has flattened wages in an array of low-skilled jobs. In some industries such as construction, tradesmen complain that this has also allowed firms to bid down contracts for installing pipes, stairs or wiring.", "“A job that used to pay me $2,500 now pays $1,200,” said Ron Vigil, 57, a carpenter from Manassas who builds custom staircases at Maple Lawn. “The Hispanics will do a job for less and they are happy, and corporate greed is a factor, too. It really affects people like me.”", "Yet some academics say the cause and effect is not so clear-cut. According to Holzer, removing immigrants from the job market would not necessarily drive up wages to a level Americans today would accept — or companies would be willing to pay.", "“Sure, that would add appeal,” Holzer said. “The problem is that if wages kept on rising, employers would start eliminating jobs, substituting technology and other norms of production. Immigration is really only one small factor.”", "The U.S.-born workers most affected by low-skilled immigration are African Americans.", "Many jobs once held by black Americans are now done by Hispanic immigrants, while black unemployment has reached 13.5 percent nationwide. One study at Harvard found that between 1960 and 2000, a 10 percent increase in immigrants in various jobs reduced black wages and employment by up to 4 percent.", "But experts say there are other reasons why many low-skilled African Americans are out of the job market. One is the large number who become lost to street life, prison and the stigma of being an ex-offender. In the District, over half of about 66,000 ex-offenders are jobless.", "According to Holzer, low-skilled black Americans may face added burdens of employer bias or may disconnect from formal education and employment systems at an early age — while immigrants make constant use of informal job grapevines.", "Also, as a result of the civil rights movement, many African Americans feel they no longer have to accept demeaning work, even if they lack the skills to do better.", "This is especially true of field work, for historical reasons.

Yet as colonial rule and wars of conquest have become increasingly obsolete, the role of political actors in intentionally triggering displacement is often overlooked in the modern era. These strategies differ in type and intensity: Authorities not only expel civilians from an area, they also ", " to designated settlements or monitored makeshift camps elsewhere. Therefore in many cases, the strategic displacement of civilian populations are not static, one-off events, but dynamic processes whereby political actors continuously seek to regulate people’s physical locations and movements. No matter how officials justify these measures, they rarely provide the resources needed to adequately address their humanitarian consequences.", "Many Middle Eastern scholars, most notably ", ", have captured the essential links between displacement and identity politics. Nationalism – the pursuit of recognition and rights by self-defined collectives – is ", ", but as Said and others have shown, is it also a ", " of it. These connections remain mostly unexamined outside the context of Palestinian nationalism, for which dislocation and dispossession ", ". But the Palestinians do not appear to be a unique case. Scholars have recognized the role of displacement in constructing ", "in Turkey and ", " in North Africa. Since identities tend to be territorially anchored, being violently uprooted can lead people to cling to their homelands, and promote an exaggerated sense of group solidarity based on the very characteristics by which individuals were displaced. Refocusing attention on how displacement is weaponized within the contemporary context can help us better understand the impact of displacement on identity politics in two important ways.", "First, displacement highlights the role of the state and its agents in reifying, politicizing, and institutionalizing national and subnational identities. ", ", the Ottoman Empire’s orchestrated expulsion and resettlement of problematic or undesirable groups made forced migration “the characteristic mark of nationalism” across much of the Middle East. Scholars tend to perceive the development of national consciousness as a bottom-up, rather than a top-down, process. But as states have increasingly “", ",” the ways in which authorities create and respond to forced migrations play a pivotal role in constructing nationalism. For displaced Palestinians, the policies and actions of the Israeli government, the discriminatory treatment of refugees by Lebanon and Jordan and the ", " of U.N. relief agencies have all enhanced the distinctiveness and political salience of Palestinian identity.", "Second, focusing on the state’s role in inducing and managing displacement draws attention to the material drivers of identity politics. Studies of nationalism often emphasize its subjective and ideational dimensions, with less attention paid to the ways in which nationalism is rooted in laws, policies and institutions. Forced migration activates nationalism by attaching specific rights, resources and recognition to particular ethnic, sectarian or national affiliations. For all the talk of Kurdish transnationalism, border restrictions, visa requirements and citizenship benefits preserve salient differences between Iraqi, Syrian and Turkish Kurds.", "Displacement therefore remains an underutilized prism for observing the dynamics of identity production in Middle Eastern politics. It also challenges popular narratives surrounding the origins of sectarian conflict in the region. Many observers ", " that Arab autocrats suppressed long-standing subnational divisions only to have them erupt after these rulers were overthrown or undermined. This obscures the fact that measures undertaken by these regimes, particularly the strategic uprooting of civilian populations, were instrumental in deepening these divisions and essentializing the identities attached to them. While frequently exercised under the auspices of national unity, these displacements had the opposite effect: They aggravated, rather than subdued, patterns of sectarian or ethnic dominance.", "Likewise, the more recent episodes of forced displacement appear to be intensifying subnational rivalries in ", ", ", " and ", ". By fragmenting society and categorizing people not as citizens but members of homogenous ethno-sectarian enclaves, displacement has inhibited attempts to develop a national identity. These processes are abetted by the fact that the primary providers of humanitarian supplies and public services for displaced communities are ", " and local religious, ethnic and tribal groups that directly or indirectly ", " on subnational affiliations, particularly among population displaced within their countries – who lack the ", " afforded to refugees.As ", " has shown, the provision of welfare can engender or reinforce community solidarity. Thus the activities of these aid groups could help augment or preserve the ethno-sectarian identities of displaced populations, just as the services provided by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees have ", ".", "Yet we should refrain from taking these developments as evidence that religious or ethnic identities are bound to overtake national ones in a region purportedly beset by vanishing borders. Despite the seeming predominance of subnational affiliations, the salience of ", "nationality – nationality based on legal citizenship – will persist as states increasingly lay claim over the regulating techniques of the politics of movement. More research is therefore needed on the impact of different forms of displacement on the production, contestation and institutionalization of political identities. Previous studies have demonstrated that displacement can consolidate or disperse identity among exiled communities, from so-called ", " to ", ". But given that civilian displacement ", "countries has become far more prevalent than displacement outside of them, it is critical that researchers focus on more localized patterns of displacement. Is being uprooted within, as opposed to across, state borders less likely to rouse nationalist sentiments? Do different processes of exclusion, assimilation and integration shape identity construction for the internally displaced via-à-vis refugees? These questions have profound importance for grasping the impact of population displacement on reordering the Middle East. If the twentieth century was the ", "then the twenty-first is shaping up to be the century of the IDP. Scholars must keep pace with these trends."]},

But similar efforts to fill holes in the background-check system, even in the wake of past deadly shootings, have fallen short.", "Any meaningful changes will require increased cooperation and voluntary efforts from individual states, many of which have spotty records in submitting information. ", "The federal database lacks the names of millions of people who should not own guns because they have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, are drug offenders or have a history of domestic violence. ", "“The system looks like Swiss cheese,” said Mark Glaze, director of ", ". “It stops a lot of bad guys from getting guns, but it lets a lot of bad guys through. Every ­mental-health record that isn’t in the system is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off in another community.”", "A 2011 study by the group found that while some states such as New York had submitted hundreds of thousands of records to the federal database, other states had lagged. Seventeen states had submitted fewer than 10 mental-health records, and four states had submitted none. ", "Virginia, according to the report, now leads the country in mental-health records submitted per capita, reflecting major changes put in place in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007. ", "According to Virginia State Police, who supply the information to NICS, the state had provided data on more than 175,000 cases as of July 2012.", "As of 2011, Maryland has shared 2,975 mental-health records with NICS, said Bill Toohey, a spokesman for Gov. Martin O’Malley’s office of crime control and prevention. Maryland law currently prohibits sharing of broader mental-health records, including civil commitments, guardianships and findings of developmental disability, although expanded information sharing for the purpose of firearms background checks could come before the state legislature this year.", "In the summer, a Government Accountability Office ", " found that from 2004 to 2011, states had submitted vastly more numbers to the national background database than they had in preceding years. The increase, however, was due largely to the efforts of a dozen states. Nearly half of all states made little or no progress in filling the void of mental-health records in the background database. ", "Some states have expressed concern about violating privacy laws by submitting mental-health records, a worry Obama tried to ease Wednesday. Other states have complained about outdated technology and a lack of resources to enter the records. ", "In the wake of the massacre at Virginia Tech, Congress passed legislation aimed at improving NICS by providing grants to states to help upgrade their technology and hire more staff to put relevant records into the national database. But in a concession to the NRA, states were eligible for the money only if they agreed to put in place a system that allowed people to appeal to have their gun-ownership rights reinstated. Many states have yet to put such a process in place. ", "Obama’s actions Wednesday took aim at much more than the national background check system, and he made a point of noting that “someone with a mental illness is far more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator.”", "The president directed federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct or sponsor research into the causes behind gun violence. The agency should be asking four basic questions, said Mark Rosenberg, who headed the agency’s division that studied gun violence in the 1990s: Who gets shot? What are the causes? What are the risk factors? What works to prevent gun deaths and injuries?", "The most critical piece, he said, is determining whether programs such as gun registration and waiting periods reduce risk. “They’re very expensive and very hard to do, and that’s why the federal government needs to be involved,” he said.", "Such research has largely vanished since the 1990s, when the NRA pushed Congress to cut funding for the CDC division that studied gun violence.", "“We don’t benefit from ignorance,” Obama said. “We don’t benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.” ", "Other restrictions in current years have included a provision in the 2010 health-care law that limited the ability of doctors to gather data about patients’ gun use, and a separate measure that prohibited the National Institutes of Health from funding studies that “advocate or promote gun control.”", "“It’s a great first step,” Michael Halpern of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists said of the president’s directive. “It’s important for the executive branch to tell researchers that their work is valued and will be protected.”", "Still, he said, the White House action could fall flat unless lawmakers on Capitol Hill also express support for researchers to delve deeper into gun-related studies.", "Some of the mental-health­related ", " put forward by the White House will need the blessing of Congress. Among them: $50 million to train 5,000 mental-health professionals serving children and young adults and another $50 million to aid young people and students facing mental-health, substance-abuse or anxiety problems.", "Obama also said he would take action to ensure that Medicaid recipients get quality mental-health coverage, finalize requirements for private health insurance plans to cover mental-health services, and dispatch Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to launch a national dialogue on mental-health issues.", " ", "Alice R.
