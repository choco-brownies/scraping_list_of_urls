To come to that conclusion, the study\u2019s authors \u2014 a team of economists and researchers from Harvard, Stanford and the Census Bureau \u2014 traced the lives of 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983.

It\u2019s also hardly unexpected that research by Ohio State University Associate Professor Cynthia Colen illustrates that middle-class and higher black Americans as well as Hispanic Americans, often have ", " than white Americans, likely due to prolonged exposure to racism.", "With so many factors beyond our control, what, I wondered, can parents of black children do to protect our sons? We can\u2019t eradicate racial bias, but, after reading the study\u2019s conclusion and talking with mental health professionals, I see hope. Here are some steps that experts say parents of black sons can take:", "Amber Hewitt, a licensed psychologist\u00a0in Washington, said providing black children with an appreciation and understanding of what it means to be black in America helps buffer the harmful effects of societal racism. \u201cBlack parents who provide their children with messages about cultural pride report less psychological distress for their children,\u201d says Hewitt. While her practice has included research and clinical expertise in identity development, resilience, and racial socialization of black boys and young men, she emphasizes that black girls should not be overlooked when discussing sociocultural obstacles. \u201cIt is true that there are differences in how black boys and black girls experience the world and how society perceives and treats them,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, I think we should be more inclusive when discussing experiences of black youth since there is a shared group experience.\u201d", "Of course, identity development can be a lot more difficult to achieve when you have limited access to positive examples of individuals from similar backgrounds, or you are mostly exposed to the negative depictions that black boys and girls are shown of themselves in movies, TV and pop culture. \u201cThe portrayal of black boys and girls in mainstream media is often one that invalidates their experiences. For example, the presence of stereotypical roles and images (e.g., angry black woman, criminal, athlete, entertainer) found in many commercials, television shows, news programs, and other forms of media is a contextual factor that impacts positive identity development,\u201d Hewitt says. In addition to exposure to positive role models, Hewitt believes that mentorship can provide an alternative to the narrow media examples that are shown to black youths.", "The \u201cRace and Economic Opportunity Study\u201d found that black boys whose fathers are present have better outcomes, and we know that having a father in the household can be a tool for identity development. However, that variable can be more difficult to control for. Thankfully, the study added that for boys without a father in the home, living in a neighborhood with present black fathers and being mentored by other black men provides a good substitute.", "Erlanger Turner, assistant professor at the University of Houston-Downtown and faculty affiliate with its Center for Critical Race Studies, agrees. \u201cIn my experience, black males that have black male mentors are more confident and self-assured when they can see themselves in certain careers. If you know someone who has achieved what you want to pursue it gives them more hope.\u201d", "Hewitt believes mentorship can also build emotional strength. \u201cMentoring can help develop resilience. The contemporary view of resilience emphasizes the relationship between the individual and their environment and how individuals navigate systems to acquire the resources needed to overcome adversity,\u201d she says. \u201cThis approach underscores the importance of self-definition and self-agency. In other words, it is important for black youth to be able to define themselves positively despite an environment that is not affirming of their identity.\u201d", "It\u2019s important for parents of black children to be mindful of the environment they raise their children in, if they have the option. According to the researchers, growing up in a diverse neighborhood with low racial bias produced black boys who do better in school and in life. Residing in affluent neighborhoods often comes with its own challenges and isn\u2019t necessarily the best environment to raise a black child. \u201cLiving in a so-called affluent area does not mean that the child will be protected from racial bias. It could be that the child experiences more bias and discrimination in more subtle, covert ways like microaggressions,\u201d explains Hewitt.", "Turner also points out that putting our children in areas where they are the only child of color can affect their sense of accomplishment later in life. \u201cOne potential consequence is experiencing what is referred to as the impostor phenomenon \u2014 the inability to internalize success or feeling like you\u2019re not deserving of success. Studies have shown that impostor feelings are associated with risk of depression and anxiety.\u201d", "After reading the study and talking to Hewitt and Turner, I have mixed feelings about the results. I\u2019d especially like to know which of these buffers yields the most benefits for black children \u2014 the researchers aren\u2019t sure. Like most black parents, my husband and I can\u2019t control for everything. We\u2019re a military family currently living in an overwhelmingly conservative and white town, and we regularly see a truck with a large Confederate flag near our neighborhood. Racial bias is inescapable. At the same time, my husband and I serve as alternative images of blackness, when compared to media portrayals. We plan to continue doing what is best for our son and hope what we accomplish makes up for what was out of our reach.

You have just deposited germs on your alarm clock. Most of us cringe when strangers cough or sneeze near us in public. But the truth is, hands are the real germ carriers. And our own hands are culprits, too. As you go about your day, your hands pick up other people's germs but also deposit germs of their own. What kinds? Mostly the ones that cause colds, flus and diarrhea, but also norovirus, staph, MRSA \u2014 and more. \n", "Let's track where the worst microbes are in the course of a day. Our tour guide?

Gerba never imagined that microbiology would make him famous, but an Internet search of his name yields more than 10,000 results. ", "As for the nickname, \"I just got stuck with that,\" Gerba said. \"If you stick your head in a toilet all day, you've got to laugh.\" Here's what Gerba has found in more than 40 years of looking for germs. ", "As you get dressed for the day, you may be coming in contact with germs. ", "\n", "You might be surprised to hear that your clothes can harbor salmonella, hepatitis and other viruses. ", "those germs and others can survive our laundry efforts because most Americans don't wash clothes in hot water or use bleach anymore.", "The solution: Use bleach or the hot cycle if you can. If not, run the dryer for more than 30 minutes, which can kill germs. ", "\n", "Time for breakfast, and Gerba says our ", " harbor far more pathogens than our bathrooms because of our own germs and those on raw meat and produce. The worst hot spots are the kitchen sink, kitchen sponge and kitchen counters. ", "The solution: Clean your kitchen sink and counter frequently with disposable disinfectant wipes, especially after handling raw meat or produce. Use paper towels, instead of a sponge, to wipe your counters. Run your sponge through the dishwasher or microwave it for one to two minutes to kill germs.", "Next, many of us head to work. ", " if you commute via bus or subway, you are six times more likely to get sick than if you walk or drive, simply because you are coming into contact with many more people and their germs. ", "The solution: Use hand sanitizer or wash your hands just after exiting public transit. And make that hand-washing thorough! When I asked Gerba the biggest mistake people make regarding germs, he instantly said: \"Not washing their hands long enough or well enough. Our study showed only half the people who went to a sink used soap in a public restroom.\"", "If you wash your hands thoroughly and then grab your purse or cellphone, you are probably defeating the purpose. Gerba has swabbed the bottoms of ", " many times and says about a third of them are contaminated with fecal bacteria, probably from being placed on public restroom floors. ", "Then there are our phones. Gerba and his team have ", " that contained 100,000 bacteria. And because they are our constant companions \u2014 at the table, on the toilet, etc.\u2014 they are uniquely positioned to spread germs. \"Viruses are a bit more mobile today than ever before because you've got mobile phones,\" Gerba said.", "The solution: Hang your purse on the bathroom hook rather than placing it on the floor. And never put a purse on your kitchen counter. Wipe your smartphone frequently with an alcohol-free antiseptic wipe. (Alcohol is not good for the screen.)", "Restrooms have their risks, but they are not the worst germ centers at your workplace.", " The ground-floor elevator button is like a petri dish of germs because everybody who uses the elevator ends up touching it. But there's something even worse. Read on!", " \"The hot spot we found in office buildings is usually the ", ",\"  Gerba said. \"Usually on the coffee pot handle. I mean, you want to be the first one to get the coffee in the morning.\" Once again, where there are many people, there are many germs. \"We found that viruses were spreading between people who had never met,\" he said. \"We figured maybe the problem was the restroom, but it was really the break room.\" When Gerba and his team deliberately placed a synthetic germ in an office break room, it spread to most every surface in the office within four hours.", " In public restrooms, Gerba says the toilet seat that we obsess over is actually pretty clean because people wipe it or use paper liners. If you want to improve your chances even more, choose the center stall, which contains fewer germs because fewer people use it. The exit door handle, another source of angst, is also pretty clean, because most people have just washed their hands. The real cesspool in a public restroom is the floor. ", "The solution: Wash your hands as soon as you get to work after exiting the elevator. Encourage your company to have a professional cleaning service swab down the break room in addition to the restroom. Wash your hands thoroughly after visiting the break room.", "If you head to a restaurant for your lunch break, some more counterintuitive findings await you there. Once again, the restaurant restroom is not the biggest problem, probably because it is frequently and professionally cleaned. So think about what everybody touches at a restaurant. .\u2009.\u2009. The menu! Gerba and his assistants found an average of 185,000 bacteria on menus in one test of restaurants in three states. You probably have about a hundred times more bacteria on that menu than you do on a typical toilet seat in the restroom.  Gerba said. \"Sticky menus are not really on my diet.\" Another potential problem spot: restaurant seats, because, if you think about it, staffers wipe down the tables, but maybe not the chairs.", "The solution: Order your food from the menu and then excuse yourself to the not-so-dirty restroom to wash your hands. Or carry hand sanitizer and use a quick squirt before eating.", "Watch out for more germs if you stop at the grocery store on your way home from work. ", " E. coli bacteria on half of the shopping cart handles he tested. If you think about it, it could have come from shoppers' hands, their babies' diapers, or raw meat they put in the cart. However, fabric grocery bags may be a bigger risk, because they provide germs a direct route from the grocery store to your home. ", " found that about half of reusable grocery bags were also contaminated with E. coli, which is associated with the fecal matter of animals and humans.", "The solution: Ask your grocery store what shopping cart sanitation measures it takes and reward stores that have a plan in place. Don't eat while you shop. Wash or sanitize your hands after shopping. Place reusable grocery bags on the floor rather than the kitchen counter while unloading. Wash your fabric grocery bags with hot water or bleach \u2014 or both. ", "Most people reading about the germs they encounter throughout the day will be disgusted, but a hardy few will scoff and say that being exposed to germs makes you stronger. To that, Gerba deadpanned, \"Or it kills you.\" After all, pathogens like E. coli and salmonella can be deadly. \"Getting sick doesn't necessarily protect you,\" Gerba said.

The study is sure to renew a vigorous debate over how much people can do to prevent cancer and how much is unavoidable.", "The researchers, mathematician Cristian Tomasetti and cancer geneticist Bert Vogelstein, both of Johns Hopkins University, set out to determine what proportion of cancer mutations are due to unpredictable DNA-copying errors \u2014 as opposed to the two other main contributors to cancer, inherited genes and environmental factors, such as smoking and obesity.", ", the scientists used a mathematical model that analyzed genome sequencing and epidemiological data for 32 types of cancer. Overall, they concluded, 66 percent of mutations that contribute to cancer are due to unavoidable DNA-replication mistakes, while 29 percent are attributable to environmental factors and 5 percent to heredity.\u00a0That doesn't mean that two-thirds of cancer cases are caused by random copying errors, they said; it can take three, four or more mutations to make a cell turn malignant.", "Moreover, the proportion of mutations due to random copying errors varies depending on the cancer, the researchers said. Random DNA-replication mistakes account for about 77 percent of critical mutations in pancreatic cancer, and virtually all childhood cancer, they said. By contrast, they concluded that more than two-thirds of the mutations in lung cancer were due to environmental factors, mostly smoking.", "Humans have trillions of cells, which are constantly regenerating by dividing and making new cells. But each time DNA is copied, the scientists said, an average of three random mistakes will occur. While most are harmless, a small number affect genes that will promote cancer.", "The new research builds on a 2015 study that highlighted the role of \u201cbad luck\u201d \u2014 random DNA errors \u2014 in developing cancer.

Brian Druker, director of the Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute, said it provided a data framework \u201cto understand much of what we already know about cancer epidemiology.\u201d Often, he said, he sees cancer patients who have had a healthy lifestyle and are looking for an explanation for their disease. \u201cOften there\u00a0", "Daniel\u00a0Haber, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said it is beside the point to focus on the specific percentage of cancer risk contributed by random errors, environmental factors and heredity. The most important point, he said, is the need for early cancer detection \u2014 something that medicine now is \u201cvery bad\u201d at.", "In their 2015 study, Tomasetti and Vogelstein compared cancer incidence in the United States to the total number of cell divisions to different kinds of tissues in the body. They wanted to determine why, for example, cancer is more likely to develop in the colon than in the brain. They found a strong correlation between cancer incidence and the number of times the stem cells in the tissues divide.\u00a0They figured that the more cells divide, the higher the potential for random DNA-copying mistakes \u2014 and attributed the errors to \u201cbad luck.\u201d", "But critics disliked the \u201cbad luck\u201d explanation and complained that the study was limited to the United States and didn't include the most common cancers \u2014 breast and prostate.", "In a new analysis also reported Thursday, which included information on breast and prostate cancers, Tomasetti and Vogelstein said they had done additional work that confirmed and broadened their 2015 conclusions.

Collectively, the fuller results undermine the conventional wisdom regarding dietary fat that has persisted for decades and is still enshrined in influential publications such as\u00a0the U.S. government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. \u00a0But the long-belated saga of the Minnesota Coronary Experiment may also make a broader point about how science gets done: it suggests just how difficult it can be for new evidence \u00a0to see the light of day when it contradicts widely held theories.", "The story begins in the late 1960s and early \u201970s, when researchers in Minnesota engaged thousands of institutionalized mental patients to compare the effects of two diets. \u00a0One group of patients was\u00a0fed a diet intended to lower blood cholesterol and reduce heart disease.

But about a quarter of the patients remained on the diet for a year or longer, and why\u00a0such an apparently well-done study received so little fanfare is mystifying to some.", "The results of the study were never touted by the investigators. Partial results were presented at an American Heart Association conference in 1975, and it wasn't until 1989 that some of the results were published, appearing in a medical journal known as Arteriosclerosis.", "The lead investigators of the trial, noted scientists Ancel Keys and Ivan Frantz, are deceased.", "Steven Broste, now a retired biostatistician, was then a student at the University of Minnesota and used the full set of data for his master's thesis in 1981. He interacted with the researchers. Part of the problem, Broste suggested in an interview, may\u00a0have been limits on statistical methods at the time. Computer software for statistics wasn't as readily available as it is today. So, at the time of the study, it wasn't as easy to know how significant the data was. Broste completed his thesis several years after the last patients had left the trial, but it was not published in a journal.", "Broste also suggested that at least part of the reason for the incomplete publication of the data might have been human nature. The Minnesota investigators had a theory that they believed in \u2014\u00a0that reducing blood cholesterol would make people healthier. Indeed, the idea was widespread and would soon be adopted by the federal government in the first dietary recommendations.

To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true:", "\u201cTrump\u2019s speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,\u201d Benesch\u00a0said in a recent interview. \u201cThe meaning is so often ambiguous.\u201d", "But when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, \u201cit seems to me impossible that people didn\u2019t understand that as a reference to violence,\u201d she said.

However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americans\u2019 belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.\u201d", "Still, that she\u2019s getting the question so often is in itself stunning.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine that so soon after beginning this work I\u2019d be asked to explain it to someone abroad who would want me to describe a case study,\u201d she said, \u201cand choose a case study in my own country.\u201d", "On an unseasonably warm fall afternoon, Benesch sat barefoot on the stone steps outside her townhouse on a tree-lined street in Washington\u2019s popular Logan Circle neighborhood.

As they pored over whom to prosecute for the terrible crimes, Benesch was drawn to the question of whether one could detect warning signs for genocide before one\u00a0occurred. People do not wake up in the morning and simultaneously decide to kill their neighbors, she thought.", "This question resurfaced several years later when she was teaching a clinic at Georgetown\u2019s law school representing refugees in asylum cases. As she and her students worked to help people piece their shattered lives back together, she began thinking anew about whether there was a way to foresee the crises that created refugees.", "It was around that time that\u00a0two good friends asked her, in the course of casual conversations, what she would do if she had one full year to work on anything she wanted without any concern for finances. Her answer came easily: She wanted to figure out whether someone could identify the kind of rhetoric that brought about social conflicts, and then whether someone could interfere with it without suppressing freedom of speech. In other words, could genocide be thwarted by simply drawing attention to the \u201cdangerous speech\u201d that precedes it?", "\u201cI\u2019ve learned a few specific things about humanity,\u201d Benesch said. \u201cFirst, people do not hate spontaneously. No one is born hating, or wanting to see or do violence. Also, no particular group \u2014\u00a0religious, ethnic, cultural or national \u2014\u00a0has a monopoly on dangerous speech. It isn\u2019t that there is something wrong with one group or another, as some have alleged. All people are capable of producing and being influenced by dangerous speech. I see that as an opportunity.\u201d", "For Benesch, it\u2019s important that people understand that the type of speech she wants to counter is different from hate speech, which she says is a broad category for which there is no agreed-upon definition. An advocate for\u00a0free speech, she does not believe that hate speech can or should be silenced. In fact, it\u2019s one of the central reasons she sought to differentiate dangerous speech.", "There\u2019s no way to say definitively when speech led to genocide or mass atrocities, because there are many contributing factors, or conversely whether Benesch\u2019s efforts to counter that speech has succeeded in quelling what would have otherwise been a mass violence situation. But she has anecdotal evidence that leads her to believe that both\u00a0are significant factors.", "After the results of the 2007 presidential election in Kenya were disputed, there were attacks that left more than 1,000 people dead and 500,000 displaced. In the lead-up to it, political leaders used incendiary language about other ethnic and tribal groups. One group, for example, said that those in another were like weeds that needed to be pulled out so \u201cthere would be only one tribe here,\u201d Benesch ", "Benesch did her first field study for the Dangerous Speech Project in Kenya leading up to its next presidential election, held in March 2013. While there she helped oversee several projects that sought to diminish the impact of dangerous speech, including one writing four episodes of a popular Kenyan courtroom comedy in which\u00a0the actors discredited inflammatory statements. The 2013 election produced little violence.", "She\u00a0is continuing to study how to effectively respond to dangerous speech. Right now, she\u2019s looking at the impact that shaming the speakers or using humor to minimize them may have.", "Her work has inspired others to take up the cause. This year the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum ", ", and its author credits Benesch as the inspiration for it.", "Rob Faris, director of the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard, where Benesch is a faculty associate, described her work as \u201cinnovative\u201d in how it attempts to delegitimize dangerous speech rather than try to stifle it, thus protecting freedom of speech.", "Her framework is still intended to discourage large incidents of violence. While she has tested some theories on dangerous speech online, her strategies are unlikely to weed out lone mass shooters or even terrorist recruits because they\u2019re too isolated.", "\u201cIn any given time, in any society there is a subset of people who hold extreme views and are willing to resort to violence, and I don\u2019t think one can suppress that or expect to wipe it out,\u201d Benesch said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m more concerned about is the large mass of people who are malleable, who can be influenced.\u201d", "Despite seeing human viciousness up close, something she said she\u2019ll never get used to, she is hopeful.", "\u201cHatred and fear and even mass atrocities are not at all new in human history \u2014 it\u2019s the widespread efforts to push back against them, that are new, and when we step back and take a longer view, we can see that these efforts are working in many contexts and many places,\u201d she said. \u201cHumans are now much less likely to die at the hands of another human than in the past.

This excess weight contributes to a variety of health problems. Despite enormous effort over decades, the problem has proved extremely difficult to solve. Biologist Satchin Panda thinks we\u2019re missing a key variable: Instead of focusing so much on what we eat, he says, we should pay more attention to when we eat.", "A researcher at the Salk Institute in San Diego, Panda argues that eating within a certain time window each day can help people lose weight and may help prevent illnesses including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In animal studies, he and others have shown that limiting food intake to a period of eight to 12 hours can boost cognitive and physical performance, and may even lengthen life span. Known as time-restricted feeding, or TRF, the approach is simple: Eat more or less what you want, but don\u2019t consume anything before or after the allotted time.", "Panda argues that humans\u2019 circadian rhythm is not designed for a world with 24-7 access to food. \u201cIf you\u2019re eating all the time, it messes up that pattern,\u201d he says. For many if not most Americans, that pattern is deeply out of whack, and many of us eat from early morning until late at night.", "It is not clear whether TRF works in humans the way it seems to work in lab mice. For one, mice and humans have very different circadian rhythms. Mice are nocturnal and sleep more than once a day. They also live for only two or three years. \u201cIt may be that for a mouse, a 16-hour fast is the equivalent of a two- or three-day fast for a human,\u201d says Courtney Peterson, a nutrition scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who is doing research on TRF in humans.", "In addition, Peterson and others say, some of the benefits of TRF may stem from decreased consumption due to the shortened eating window: It\u2019s not really surprising that cutting out the after-dinner drink and the late-night sundae is good for weight loss and overall health. And, in fact, studies in humans and animals have found that TRF helps both mice and people eat fewer calories.", "Panda first got interested in TRF 15 years ago, while studying the genetics of circadian rhythm. His research on mice revealed that over the course of a day, hundreds of liver genes turn on and off cyclically. The liver plays a central role in metabolizing calories, and it turned out that most of these cyclic genes were involved in eating and digestion. This led him to ask whether mice \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 were programmed to eat according to a certain circadian schedule. In 2008, he began examining how mice responded to different feeding schedules; to his surprise, TRF had powerful ", ".", "The researchers compared two groups of mice, both of which consumed the same number of calories. One group was limited to an eight-hour window, while the other could eat at any time. After four months, the eight-hour mice weighed 28 percent less than the anytime eaters. \u201cWhen we saw the results, they were so unexpected,\u201d he says. \u201cEven I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d", "He had his students independently repeat the experiment three times; all of the results were similar. Using the same model \u2014 two groups eating an equal number of calories, but on different feeding schedules \u2014 he ", " that TRF mice had normal blood sugar levels, while the unlimited-schedule animals developed Type 2 diabetes. Since then, he has shown that TRF can reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. In addition, mice restricted to an eight- or nine-hour eating window could run for twice as long as those that ate on a normal schedule.", "\u201cTRF is an interesting and valuable idea, but it\u2019s not proven that it works in humans,\u201d says nutrition researcher David Allison, dean of the University of Indiana School of Public Health. \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that it might be useful for some things. But it\u2019s extraordinarily complex to actually nail this down.\u201d", "Overall, he says, the evidence indicates that eating most of your food earlier in the day is probably healthier than eating most of your food later in the day. He also notes that there are many complexities to the issue, including the fact that most people eat healthier food at breakfast (oatmeal or cereal, for instance) than they do at dinner (hamburger, fries and dessert).", "Some evidence from research involving humans indicates that TRF has benefits even when people don\u2019t eat any less. In a study that is soon to be published, Peterson examined eight men with pre-diabetes, a condition in which people are close to being diabetic but not quite there. Researchers prepared all food in the study, and the participants ate it under supervision. The men tried two schedules: eating all their meals between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., and between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Compared with the 12-hour schedule, the six-hour window significantly lowered blood pressure and improved insulin sensitivity, the ability to process glucose.", "\u201cWe were really excited about the results,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cIt was a small study, but it was done extremely carefully.\u201d In a similar study, also not yet published, she looked at 11 overweight people who followed the same two regimens. Although those in the six-hour window did not increase the overall number of calories they burned, they did increase the amount of fat they burned and reduced levels of a key hunger hormone called ghrelin; these metabolic changes might make it easier to lose weight and body fat.", "\u201cI think that within 10 years we will have some really clear guidelines for meal timing,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cBut we are in the early stages of this research. There is a lot more work we need to do.\u201d", "In 2015, Panda ", " of 156 adults; more than half spread food consumption over 15 hours or longer, while only 10 percent consistently ate within a 12-hour window. He followed up with eight of these people, who were overweight and typically ate for 14 hours or more a day. When the subjects were limited to a 10-hour window for four months, with no other restrictions \u2014 they could eat whatever they wanted \u2014 they lost weight, slept better and had more energy.", "Panda is now starting a study that will eventually include thousands of adults worldwide. Using a custom smartphone app that allows people to take photos of what they eat and immediately send them to researchers, he will be able to more accurately track which foods people eat. Using this data, he will examine whether TRF can improve weight, blood sugar, blood pressure, joint pain, sleep, anxiety and inflammation.", "Panda says that mice and humans \u2014 and probably most organisms \u2014 are not built to simultaneously ingest food and metabolize it. \u201cEverything cannot happen at once,\u201d Panda says. \u201cThe body can\u2019t take in calories and break down calories at the same time.\u201d He and other circadian scientists say that many if not most animals have evolved to consume food according to the 24-hour solar cycle. For humans, this rhythm involves eating during the day and sleeping after sunset. With the advent of electric lights, refrigerators, microwaves and 7-Elevens, millions if not billions of us have jettisoned this pattern. But the circadian rhythm of our metabolism still expects us to stop eating at sundown. This mismatch between modern society and programmed biology can lead to myriad health problems, Panda and others say.", "It is not clear exactly how TRF works, but it seems to trigger several molecular changes. It increases the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body; it boosts levels of ketone bodies, molecules produced by the liver during fasting, which are a powerful source of energy and are especially useful to muscle and brain cells; it also raises production of brown fat, the \u201cgood\u201d fat that helps the body burn more energy. Together, these mechanisms allow the body to generate more energy and metabolize calories more efficiently than unscheduled eating.", "TRF is just one of several approaches that involve fasting. Scientists are also looking at intermittent fasting, which typically involves eating every other day, or eating for five days and then fasting for two.", "Valter Longo, a gerontologist at the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, has focused on an approach in which people eat very little for five days at a time, several times a year. Other researchers are examining calorie restriction, which requires reducing calorie intake below normal levels, for months, years or longer, in hopes of triggering a variety of beneficial physiological responses. Studies of animals and humans have found that these regimens can have benefits, including weight loss, lower rates of cancer, diabetes and heart disease, and, in some animal studies, significantly longer life span.", "All of these strategies have some similarities to TRF, Panda says, with one major difference: They are much more difficult to follow. Whereas TRF involves relatively minor adjustments in how most people already eat, intermittent fasting and calorie restriction often require hunger and discipline for long periods.", "This, he says, is why TRF has potential as a public health strategy. In a society where Big Gulps and Big Macs are ubiquitous, unhealthy eating and obesity are very hard to avoid. TRF, Panda contends, offers a simple, relatively manageable alternative. \u201cJust by changing when we eat, we can have an effect on obesity and these related problems,\u201d Panda says. \u201cThis can really move the needle.\u201d", "Panda himself has adopted TRF and says he\u2019s seen benefits: lower blood sugar, weight loss, better sleep and more energy. He now uses a modified version, in which he eats breakfast at 7 a.m., skips lunch and has dinner with his family at around 7 p.m. In essence, he has two long fasts a day, between meals and overnight. Others around him have adopted the classic TRF regimen, including his 15-year-old daughter, his mother and several graduate students in his lab. He says his mother had pre-diabetes before starting the diet; since then, her blood sugar has dropped significantly, to a healthy level.", "So far, TRF has not caught on widely. Peterson, the UAB scientist, is one of the early adopters. Five to seven days a week, she limits her consumption to a six- or seven-hour window, usually eating between 8 a.m. and 2 or 3 p.m. She says she has more energy, feels a bit calmer and doesn\u2019t feel particularly hungry in the afternoon or evening.", "\u201cYou have to adapt to it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I first started trying this, I found 10 hours was hard.

Singh has served at the helm of Maryland\u2019s military, the first African American and first woman to hold the role of adjutant general for the Maryland National Guard.", "In June, \u200b\u200bBrig. Gen. Janeen L. Birckhead took over as assistant adjutant general for Army, and in August, Brig. Gen. April Vogel began serving as assistant adjutant general for Air. Then, in December, Command Sgt. Maj. Perlisa D. Wilson became senior enlisted adviser for Maryland\u2019s National Guard.", "The female-powered staff was, in many ways, entirely unintentional, Singh said. When the positions opened up, Singh by no means was seeking an all-female leadership team \u2014 she simply wanted the most qualified candidates available, she said.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t even realize that it was going to line up this way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I engineered it for all of them to end up in these positions. It just so happened that these talented ones started rising to the top.\u201d", "The elevation of women within Maryland\u2019s National Guard comes as women across the country continue to rise in the ranks of the military, taking on roles that were previously only filled by men. It was just over three years ago that women were granted the right to serve in combat posts in the U.S. military.", "Since then, the first women have graduated from the Army\u2019s most physically challenging training, the Ranger School, and from the Marine Corps\u2019 Infantry Officer Course. For the first time, a woman is leading an infantry platoon in the Marines. And in February, amid a long-running debate over whether women should be included in the draft, a federal judge ruled that a male-only draft is unconstitutional.", "But even in Maryland, the military continues to be a field overwhelmingly dominated by men. Before Birckhead was promoted to brigadier general, she was one of about 25 colonels in the Maryland Army National Guard \u2014 and she was the only woman.", "\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t want is to have a female leadership team that\u2019s not competent,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThey had to be competent \u2014 just as competent, if not more competent, than their peers.\u201d", "These female leaders have also been tested in ways many of their male counterparts haven\u2019t.", "Growing up in Frederick County, Md., Singh ran away from home as a teenager after being sexually abused by a relative, she said. She was homeless and dropped out of high school but went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree and multiple master\u2019s degrees. Over 30 years in the military, she served in Kosovo and Afghanistan and was awarded the Bronze Star. As a civilian, she also served as a managing director for consulting firm Accenture.", "In college, during Birckhead\u2019s Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (ROTC) training at Hampton University, she said, a professor began making inappropriate advances toward her, asking her to redo some work alone with him at night. Birckhead filed a harassment claim, and the professor was removed from the position, she said.", "Wilson recalled how, about 15 years ago, she struggled to get promoted to sergeant, which at that time required appearing before a board. \u201cEvery time I went, I was the only female,\u201d she said.", "She appeared before the board twice and wasn\u2019t selected. \u201cOne time I went before the board that morning and won soldier of the year for the battalion, and later that day I went for a promotion and didn\u2019t get selected,\u201d she said.", "Each of the women credited other female National Guard leaders for noticing their talent, helping elevate them, and for urging them to aim higher. Wilson recalled when, early in her career, she was promoted to private second class, and she watched as a female superior was promoted to staff sergeant. At the promotion ceremony, the staff sergeant told the first sergeant she wanted to someday reach his rank.", "At that same promotion ceremony, as Wilson received her private second class pin, she told the first sergeant: \u201cI want to get to where she gets.\u201d", "Both women ended up far exceeding their goals. When Wilson ended up being promoted to sergeant major, the other female leader was there to pin her at her ceremony.", "\u201cI started seeing talent in these particular individuals years and years ago,\u201d Singh said of her female leadership staff. \u201cIf I have a seat at the table, how can I be their champion to ensure that they\u2019re getting the opportunity?\u201d", "Having women at the helm of the National Guard has proved essential, not only to recruiting and elevating women, but also to retaining women \u2014 particularly mothers, said Vogel, who is also an Air National Guard adviser to the secretary of the Air Force.", "As mothers, Vogel and the other female leaders said they can empathize with soldiers seeking advice for balancing motherhood with their military careers.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have somebody who\u2019s been there,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of young women who have asked to speak with me and said .\u2009.\u2009. \u2018How did you handle this?

The busing system has skirted those dangers, generating few reports of violence or mistreatment, U.S. officials say.", "Within 72 hours of leaving the staging areas, the buses arrive at predetermined drop-off points within walking distance of the U.S. border.

All low-income youths in a state experience the general restrictions the state puts in place, but immigrant eligibility restrictions affect only immigrants\u00a0and others in their\u00a0families and communities. States\u2019 decisions about immigrant eligibility had no effect on the graduation rates of low-income, native-born, black or white youths, who weren\u2019t subject to the restriction and weren\u2019t likely to experience spillover effects.", "Why would being excluded from social welfare programs lead some children of immigrants to drop out of high school? There are a number of reasons. Without the income from TANF, parents may need to work longer hours, leaving kids unsupervised.

Experts say that the violence that was a key factor in driving people to flee Central America last year has surged again, with the homicide rate in El Salvador reaching its highest level in a generation.

This change was recommended by its own expert committee, which found that cholesterol is no longer \u201ca nutrient of concern.\u201d", "But elsewhere in the report, the guidelines cite a 16-year-old report from the Institute of Medicine and advises people to \u201ceat as little dietary cholesterol as possible while consuming a healthy eating pattern.\u201d", "Similarly, the report calls for people to limit the amount of saturated fat in their diet to 10 percent of their calories, and accordingly to choose milk and other dairy products that are no-fat or low-fat.

The guidelines stop short of encouraging people to take up the coffee habit.", "The new version of the Dietary Guidelines also slightly softens the warning about salt.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) found himself at odds\u00a0with some immigration reform advocates Thursday, defending his 2007 vote against a comprehensive immigration bill and telling an audience hosted by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that \"open borders\" were a threat to American jobs.", "\"There is a reason that Wall Street likes immigration reform,\" Sanders said. \"What I think they\u2019re interested in is seeing a process by which we can bring low-wage labor into this county.\"", "Sanders, who supported the 2013 version of immigration reform, had already waded into a moral and economic fight inside the Democratic Party. The latest round began with ", " with Vox's Ezra Klein, who asked if Sanders could favor \"sharply raising the level of immigration we permit, even up to a level of open borders.\"", "The Vermont senator vehemently disagreed. \"That's a Koch brothers proposal,\" he said. \"What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that.\"", "Many progressives do believe in that. They've argued for it, in the face of opposition from many labor unions. In the run-up to Sanders's appearance, Democrats who want to blunt his campaign had circulated the Vox interview and excerpts from his old statements about immigration and protectionism. When reporters were invited to ask questions, all but one asked about immigration. CNN's Dan Merica read back some of Sanders's quotes about the 2007 immigration bill and invited the senator to respond.", "\u201cMy concern about the bill that I voted against,\u201d said Sanders, \u201cwas that there was too much emphasis on bringing low-wage workers into this country. What I want to see, and what is better about the recent bill, is a pathway toward citizenship, which is absolutely essential.\u201d", "MSNBC's Alex Seitz-Wald read to Sanders from a statement by the pro-reform group FWD.us, funded and founded by some large corporations to advocate for the 2013 bill. According to FWD, Sanders had embraced -- for years, but especially in his talk with Vox -- \"the\u00a0totally-debunked notion that immigrants coming to the U.S. are taking jobs and hurting Americans.\"", "Sanders disputed that. \"You\u2019ve got to be careful about defining the word, \u2018immigrants,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are talking about is completely opening up the border. That was the question, should we have a completely open border, so that anybody can come into the United States of America. If that were to happen, which I strongly disagree with, there is no question in my mind that that was substantially lower wages in this country.", "\"When you have 36 percent of Hispanic kids in this country who can\u2019t find jobs, and you bring a lot of unskilled workers into this country, what do you think happens to that 36 percent of kids who are today unemployed? Fifty-one percent of African-American kids? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any presidential candidate, none, who thinks we should open up the borders,\" said Sanders.", "In another answer, to Huffington Post reporter Elise Foley, Sanders insisted that he could support the 2013 immigration bill without favoring the surge in visas that Wall Street wanted. \"There is a great difference in saying that we welcome immigrants, that we're going to provide a path toward citizenship to those immigrants that are in this country today, and saying: Oh, we're not going to have any borders at all,\" said Sanders.", "The senator did not further explain why open borders would suppress wages and job opportunity, while a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the country would not. \"Some of my Republican colleagues apparently think that the solution is, I guess, to round up everybody and throw them out of the country,\" said Sanders, who referred several times to the story of his immigrant parents. \"If suddenly, every undocumented worker in this country disappears, the economy would collapse.\"", "Still, Sanders's economic arguments fell flat with Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who moderated the\u00a0event.", "\"I think he's a bit off the mark,\" said Palomarez. \"I think he's likening allowing more immigrants coming into the country to taking American jobs. Our position is that some of these jobs [are some] that some of our young people wouldn't take. We don't see young people lining up to pluck chickens.\"", "Palomarez, who was hosting vetting sessions with some of Sanders's rivals, said he appreciated that the senator was at least honest about his protectionism. \"He didn't try to bullshit his way through the response, frankly.

As my ", ", ALEC is not only insisting that it doesn\u2019t deny climate change \u2014 it\u2019s threatening to sue those who suggest otherwise.", "The group, which suffered the highly visible defection of Google because of its global-warming stance and an exodus of other top corporate members, sent letters to Common Cause and the League of Conservation Voters instructing them to \u201cremove all false or misleading material\u201d alleging ALEC questions global-warming theory. ", "The problem for ALEC is that as recently as 2013, it was still reaffirming \u201cmodel legislation\u201d calling on states to consider \u201clegitimate and scientifically defensible alternative hypotheses\u201d to the \u201cmainstream scientific positions\u201d on climate. The proposed legislation states that there is \u201ca great deal of scientific uncertainty\u201d about the matter and suggests states treat possible beneficial effects of carbon \u201cin an evenhanded manner.\u201d ", "The turnabout at ALEC follows an about-face at the Heartland Institute, a libertarian outfit that embraces a description of it as \u201cthe world\u2019s most prominent think tank promoting skepticism about man-made climate change.\u201d", "But on Christmas Eve, Justin Haskins, a blogger and editor at Heartland, penned an article for the conservative journal Human Events declaring: \u201cThe real debate is not whether man is, in some way, contributing to climate change; it\u2019s true that the science is settled on that point in favor of the alarmists.\u201d ", "Haskins called it \u201ca rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life,\u201d and he suggested work on \u201ctechnologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economies.\u201d ", "To be sure, this is a tactical retreat, and you shouldn\u2019t expect conservative groups to start lining up in favor of a carbon tax.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and presidential candidates Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio have adopted this response, and Rubio has joined Mitt Romney and Chuck Grassley in embracing the less assailable position that U.S. efforts to restrict carbon are pointless without similar efforts across the globe.

Beginning in the 1970s, \u201cArabization\u201d campaigns, which expelled ethnic minorities and resettled Arab families in their place, became a hallmark of Baath Party rule in ", " and ", ". Saddam Hussein resurrected these measures after the first Gulf War, responding to Kurdish and Shiite uprisings by ", ", including residents of the Hammar, Amarah and Huwizeh marshes. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces have ", " to force civilians out of insurgent-held areas, adopting a strategy used in the 1980s by his father and then-President Hafez al-Assad, to put down revolts by the Muslim Brotherhood. The Israeli government has routinely expelled Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank. And in recent months, the Egyptian military has ", " thousands of Sinai residents to establish a buffer zone with the Gaza Strip aimed at stemming the influx of arms and militants across the border.", "The use of these measures has enabled governments (and aspiring governments) to assert control over contested areas, monitor restive populations and engage in social engineering as a part of state-led development. Displacement has been more than an expedient military tactic; it has been an essential state-building instrument. Inducing population movements helps leaders consolidate their authority while achieving a critical requirement of modernization: The physical concentration of the populace into regimented units, rendering even the most unruly or inaccessible territories \u201clegible,\u201d in the words of ", "These displacement strategies are nothing new. Population transfers have been a feature of territorial acquisition, military domination and imperial subjugation since antiquity. Yet as colonial rule and wars of conquest have become increasingly obsolete, the role of political actors in intentionally triggering displacement is often overlooked in the modern era. These strategies differ in type and intensity: Authorities not only expel civilians from an area, they also ", " to designated settlements or monitored makeshift camps elsewhere. Therefore in many cases, the strategic displacement of civilian populations are not static, one-off events, but dynamic processes whereby political actors continuously seek to regulate people\u2019s physical locations and movements. No matter how officials justify these measures, they rarely provide the resources needed to adequately address their humanitarian consequences.", "Many Middle Eastern scholars, most notably ", ", have captured the essential links between displacement and identity politics. Nationalism \u2013 the pursuit of recognition and rights by self-defined collectives \u2013 is ", ", but as Said and others have shown, is it also a ", " of it. These connections remain mostly unexamined outside the context of Palestinian nationalism, for which dislocation and dispossession ", ". But the Palestinians do not appear to be a unique case. Scholars have recognized the role of displacement in constructing ", "in Turkey and ", " in North Africa. Since identities tend to be territorially anchored, being violently uprooted can lead people to cling to their homelands, and promote an exaggerated sense of group solidarity based on the very characteristics by which individuals were displaced. Refocusing attention on how displacement is weaponized within the contemporary context can help us better understand the impact of displacement on identity politics in two important ways.", "First, displacement highlights the role of the state and its agents in reifying, politicizing, and institutionalizing national and subnational identities. ", ", the Ottoman Empire\u2019s orchestrated expulsion and resettlement of problematic or undesirable groups made forced migration \u201cthe characteristic mark of nationalism\u201d across much of the Middle East. Scholars tend to perceive the development of national consciousness as a bottom-up, rather than a top-down, process. But as states have increasingly \u201c", ",\u201d the ways in which authorities create and respond to forced migrations play a pivotal role in constructing nationalism. For displaced Palestinians, the policies and actions of the Israeli government, the discriminatory treatment of refugees by Lebanon and Jordan and the ", " of U.N. relief agencies have all enhanced the distinctiveness and political salience of Palestinian identity.", "Second, focusing on the state\u2019s role in inducing and managing displacement draws attention to the material drivers of identity politics. Studies of nationalism often emphasize its subjective and ideational dimensions, with less attention paid to the ways in which nationalism is rooted in laws, policies and institutions. Forced migration activates nationalism by attaching specific rights, resources and recognition to particular ethnic, sectarian or national affiliations. For all the talk of Kurdish transnationalism, border restrictions, visa requirements and citizenship benefits preserve salient differences between Iraqi, Syrian and Turkish Kurds.", "Displacement therefore remains an underutilized prism for observing the dynamics of identity production in Middle Eastern politics. It also challenges popular narratives surrounding the origins of sectarian conflict in the region. Many observers ", " that Arab autocrats suppressed long-standing subnational divisions only to have them erupt after these rulers were overthrown or undermined. This obscures the fact that measures undertaken by these regimes, particularly the strategic uprooting of civilian populations, were instrumental in deepening these divisions and essentializing the identities attached to them. While frequently exercised under the auspices of national unity, these displacements had the opposite effect: They aggravated, rather than subdued, patterns of sectarian or ethnic dominance.", "Likewise, the more recent episodes of forced displacement appear to be intensifying subnational rivalries in ", ", ", " and ", ". By fragmenting society and categorizing people not as citizens but members of homogenous ethno-sectarian enclaves, displacement has inhibited attempts to develop a national identity. These processes are abetted by the fact that the primary providers of humanitarian supplies and public services for displaced communities are ", " and local religious, ethnic and tribal groups that directly or indirectly ", " on subnational affiliations, particularly among population displaced within their countries \u2013 who lack the ", " afforded to refugees.As ", " has shown, the provision of welfare can engender or reinforce community solidarity. Thus the activities of these aid groups could help augment or preserve the ethno-sectarian identities of displaced populations, just as the services provided by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees have ", ".", "Yet we should refrain from taking these developments as evidence that religious or ethnic identities are bound to overtake national ones in a region purportedly beset by vanishing borders. Despite the seeming predominance of subnational affiliations, the salience of ", "nationality \u2013 nationality based on legal citizenship \u2013 will persist as states increasingly lay claim over the regulating techniques of the politics of movement. More research is therefore needed on the impact of different forms of displacement on the production, contestation and institutionalization of political identities. Previous studies have demonstrated that displacement can consolidate or disperse identity among exiled communities, from so-called ", " to ", ". But given that civilian displacement ", "countries has become far more prevalent than displacement outside of them, it is critical that researchers focus on more localized patterns of displacement. Is being uprooted within, as opposed to across, state borders less likely to rouse nationalist sentiments? Do different processes of exclusion, assimilation and integration shape identity construction for the internally displaced via-\u00e0-vis refugees? These questions have profound importance for grasping the impact of population displacement on reordering the Middle East. If the twentieth century was the ", "then the twenty-first is shaping up to be the century of the IDP. Scholars must keep pace with these trends."]},

The note included a bill for $3.25 in unpaid tolls, plus a stern warning: Failure to pay could result in additional penalties, suspension of his car registration and, finally, a collection agency on his tail. ", "After consulting his travel calendar and determining his family\u2019s movements on that fateful night, he cracked the mystery. His son had driven the car on Maryland\u2019s Intercounty Connector, an all-electronic toll road. According to Papa Townsend, his child\u2019s defense was, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that was a toll road.\u201d", "The nation\u2019s next generation of roads is paved in asphalt and confusion. As the toll-collecting setup transforms into unmanned lanes with electronic payment systems, cash is becoming as useless as wampum; the main currency is the transponder. Toll plazas are also disappearing, with streamlined arches kicking the clunky concrete stations to the curbside. Toll collectors are also facing extinction, joining lamplighters, pinsetters and switchboard operators on the island of obsolete occupations.", "\u201cThis is the latest road hazard you have to worry about,\u201d said Townsend. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to negotiate the toll roads, you\u2019re just adding headaches, cost in administrative fees and shock when the letter comes in the mail.\u201d", "On Thanksgiving, the busiest travel day of the year, AAA estimates that 43.6\u00a0 million travelers will drive at least 50 miles from their homes. Most likely, a significant number of pilgrims will cruise the 5,365 miles of toll roads that doodle through 35 states. To reach Grandma\u2019s holiday table in Connecticut, for example, a Washington-based grandkid will pony up in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and New York, but not the Constitution State, which abolished tolls in the 1980s. With the struggling economy breathing down legislators\u2019 backs, the free joy ride could soon become a relic as well. ", "To avoid a humbug drive that can sour any sweet potato pie, we asked the experts for advice on navigating the 21st-century circuit of roads. They offered money-saving tips and stress-reducing guidance and even inspired a holiday gift idea: Surprise your loved one with a transponder, the St. Christopher of toll roads. ", "We can thank the British for the tradition of Thanksgiving and blame them for toll roads. If only we could have combined the two and set up a payment system in turkey leftovers.", "In the United States, the first routes requiring a penny in the bucket appeared in the late 1700s, in the commerce-rich states of Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut. In the 1920s, tolls helped subsidize the infrastructure boom from sea to shining sea. Today, 104 toll agencies make sure that we pay for the roads beneath our wheels.", "Toll-collecting as we know it \u2014 reduced-speed lanes, a last-minute scramble for change, a sometimes pleasant exchange with the collector \u2014 all changed in 1989. That year, Dallas went big and bold with the country\u2019s first electronic tolling system, the Dallas North Tollway. In 2010, authorities completely phased out manual stations on the 32-mile stretch from downtown Dallas to the town of Frisco. Florida and Colorado are also at the forefront of the techno movement, with many other states, such as Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, close behind.", "\u201cIn the future, many more agencies will convert to all-electronic tolls,\u201d said Jim Ely, vice chairman of toll services at HNTB Corp., an infrastructure consulting firm. \u201cTo have to stop and pay cash just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d", "Saves time, eradicates lines. Can electronic tolls also remind people to turn off their directional signals? Probably not, but the cashless systems are safer. For example, replacing traditional plazas with gantries, overhead spans mounted with scanners and video cameras, eliminates dangerous obstructions and behaviors, such as the chaotic lane dance of cars. They\u2019re also more efficient: Manual collectors can process 200 to 400 cars per lane per hour, a fraction of the supermachine\u2019s pace of 2,200 per hour. And faster: Cars zip through e-tolls at highway speeds. And cheaper to operate: A potentially sensitive subject, but Ely said, \u201cOn every conversion I am aware of, toll agency management worked with their toll collection staff to find other employment or different positions with the agency.\u201d For instance, on Florida\u2019s Turnpike, some of the 300 affected employees were reassigned to other jobs.", "Although the toll road revolution is certain, it won\u2019t be a Terminator takeover. Many sites are mid-conversion. You might come across one with electronic lanes in the middle and a few operator-run booths in the wings. Or a row of coin-accepting baskets, but no one to change a buck for four quarters. In New Jersey and Illinois, I idled before the maw of the toll with no food to feed it, despite a thorough search of pockets, bags and the back seat. I had only one choice: Put a foot on the accelerator and go.", "But driving the future while I was still in the past cost me \u2014 $25 for two tolls. ", "When you receive a letter describing your transgression at the tollbooth, your first response is denial. Why would ", " be driving on a New Jersey toll road, in a rental car with Virginia plates, at 1:57 a.m.? Then a slow realization begins to dawn: Oh, right, I was in Atlantic City that weekend. Next, reality hits: I owe how much? And then self-reflection. In this final phase, you\u2019ll think about what you should have done differently. This is where I can help: I call it the $18 Penalty Fee Lesson. ", "To avoid any charges or conundrums, avoid toll roads. Some GPS devices and programs, such as here.com, can map out a toll-free route. Trapster, an online and mobile service that alerts drivers to road hazards, has a similar function. ", "Of course, back roads can be more time-consuming and head-scratchingly confusing. Chandra Bhat, director of the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Texas at Austin, says that travelers need to weigh the cost of travel against the value of time and reliability. A vacationer in the mood for a leisurely canter through the countryside, for instance, might not mind a slow, circuitous route; a family with a two-day pass to Disney World, however, will begrudge every stoplight and school crossing. ", "\u201cIf you\u2019ve invested a good bit of money in your trip,\u201d said Bhat, \u201cyou don\u2019t mind paying an additional amount if you can get there faster.\u201d", "If you frequent certain roads, such as Interstate 95 or Florida\u2019s Turnpike, purchase a transponder. E-ZPass, for example, covers 14 states, from Maine to Virginia to Illinois, and is available by phone and online and at transportation service centers and a variety of retailers (depending on the issuing state), such as AAA Mid- Atlantic, Giant and Wegmans. In Florida, the SunPass portable and mini-transponders cover the 460-mile turnpike, including the 47-mile all-electronic section in South Florida; they are sold online, by phone and at turnpike service plazas and such stores as Publix supermarkets and CVS. As with a GPS unit, you can transfer the gadget between your various vehicles, including a rental car. However, before you set off on your adventure, make sure that you register the additional car to your account, if necessary.", "If you prefer to skip the transponder, then get ready to say \u201ccheese\u201d to the video toll. As you drive beneath the gantry, cameras will snap a picture of your license plate. The agency will send an invoice to your residence. ", "\u201cThis is not a violation,\u201d said Neil Gray, director of government affairs at the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association. \u201cThere\u2019s no implication of being bad. You were just choosing your method of payment.\u201d ", "The video tolling fee, however, is more expensive than the amount charged to a transponder, based on the expense of tracking you down. Up to a third more, according to Gray. In the case of AAA\u2019s Townsend, he paid 150 percent extra for two tolls.", "If you rent a car, the options still revolve around transponders and video tolling, but with a few twists. Some companies rent the gadgets for a daily fee, plus the cost of the tolls. The charges are automatically applied to your credit card. A number of agencies preemptively equip their vehicles with transponders or a similar drive-through payment system. The renter can activate the mechanism at his or her discretion. (To flip the switch, you might simply open the transponder box or cruise through a cashless lane.) ", "Avis and Budget, for instance, suited up their vehicles with transponders that foot the bill for E-ZPass, TxTag in Texas and Florida\u2019s SunPass. The company charges $2.95 per day (with a maximum charge of $14.75 per month), plus tolls. Enterprise Holdings\u2019s Alamo, Enterprise and National outlets use TollPass video monitoring, which works in Northern California, Colorado, Texas and Florida. Renters pay $3 per day of usage (with a $15 ceiling), plus tolls. ", "\u201cYou pay for what you use, but nothing more,\u201d said Enterprise Holdings spokeswoman Laura Bryant.", "But here\u2019s the $18 catch. Some roadways do not accept the rental car companies\u2019 video tolling programs. The toll agency will cite the rental car firms for the violation. ", ". In May, on a dark and lonely road in New Jersey, I was that who. ", "To beat the surcharge, use a transponder or visit the toll authority\u2019s Web site and pay online. Just remember to jot down the toll station and rental car license plate number. Though I came up short of coins on the Illinois Tollway, I paid online within seven days and never had to fear ", ".
